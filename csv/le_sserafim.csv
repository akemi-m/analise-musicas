[Verse 1: Kazuha,

Shades on my eyes, cover my tears
You see the smile, I feel the fear so
Paint my lips red, throw on some heels
Hold up my head and tonight, I'll remind myself that

Don't love me for somebody I'm not
[Chorus: Kim Chaewon,
Huh Yunjin

I'm burning hot (

And it won't burn out after dark (

Shades on my eyes cover my tears
You see the smile, I feel the fear so
Paint my lips red, throw on some heels
Hold up my head and tonight, I'll remind myself that

Don't love me for somebody I'm not

LE SSERAFIM - Born Fire (English Translation) Lyrics
[Spoken 1: Kim Chaewon,
Huh Yunjin
,
Sakura
]
I want to know what to do
The flame engulfed the silence, splitting apart the dark
The fire grew larger chasing after the illusion of the unreachable sun
[Spoken 2: Hong Eunchae,
Kazuha
,
Huh Yunjin
]
I want to know what I want to say
It's the place to be Love
Attracted by the beautiful shimmering, I believed that the only reason for existence was to burn even brighter
In the end, it devoured itself and scatterеd to ashes
A paradoxical existencе
A vanishing point of blue light in finite time
[Spoken 3: Kim Chaewon,
Huh Yunjin
,
Sakura
]
My name is a sliver
All I can say is that I am a sliver
The name of the sky, etched onto the soul
The fire awakens again from the ashes as a kindling
[Spoken 4: Huh Yunjin, Kazuha, Hong Eunchae, Kim Chaewon, *Sakura*]
The ember, with its resilient heat, melts the coarse grains to translucence
Illuminating lost eyes in a corner of the darkness
I am the one who is lost in the darkness
I am the one who is lost in the darkness revealed
Information in English
*The spark is rekindled by hot breath*
At last, the flame is born"

I'm about to bloom again

I want you to stop time
The moment the flame burns me, finally, I can breathe
In the wave of pain
I'm turning into ashes, live again like oh, oh, oh
The more it hurts, the more alive I am
A new born from ashes, nothing lasts forever, baby
I'm about to bloom again, pour oil all over my body
Light the flame like oh, oh, oh, I don't wanna stop
[Interlude]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah
Even I burn again, I burn it more, can't get enough
Oh, no-oh (Ooh-ah), oh, no-oh (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy; Ooh-ah)

So beautiful, new life
When new skin renewal on my body after peeling the old one
After midnight, a new life will begin
Spread my wings to a new day like oh, oh, oh
The more it hurts, the more alive I am
A new born from ashes nothing lasts forever, baby
Burn it up, make it bluer
My footsteps will remain in the flames like oh, oh, oh"

LE SSERAFIM - So Cynical (Badum) (English Translation) Lyrics
[Intro]
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
[Verse 1: Kim Chaewon,
Kazuha
]
Pretend you don't know, why are you acting so extra?
Our hearts are already racing
That L-O-V-E, I only heard about it in words
Love is fictional, I never knew it’d be like this
[Pre-Chorus: Huh Yunjin,
Hong Eunchae
,
Sakura
,
Kim Chaewon
]
Tapping on it twice with one hand
Why are you trying to hide your expression?
That three-letter word, ""I like you""
Saying it out loud is so uncool
Hurry up before you miss it all
Sometimes, boldness is better
Don't doubt you and I, right this moment
[Chorus: Huh Yunjin,
Kazuha
]
I want your lo-lo-lo-loving
Let's stop pretending otherwise
Wa-wa-wa-want it
We both want that
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
My heart is kno-no-no-nocking
You can hear it too
Your lo-lo-lo-loving, let’s stop being afraid like
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum



[Verse 2: Kazuha,
Hong Eunchae
]
Rеplay old days, back then, I was so afraid
Scared of getting hurt, my closеd off heart was so blue
But now it's time to make a choice, don't avoid it
Don't make up nonsense, what you waiting for?
[Pre-Chorus: Kazuha,
Sakura
,
Hong Eunchae
,
Huh Yunjin
]
I like cool relationships
But not when it comes to you
That three-letter word, ""I like you""
Saying it out loud is so uncool
Hurry up before you miss it all
Sometimes, boldness is better
Don't doubt you and I, right this moment
[Chorus: Kim Chaewon,
Huh Yunjin
,
Kazuha
]
I want your lo-lo-lo-loving
Let's stop pretending otherwise
Wa-wa-wa-want it
We both want that
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
My heart is kno-no-no-nocking
You can hear it too
Your lo-lo-lo-loving, let's stop being afraid like
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum



[Post-Chorus: Kazuha,
Kim Chaewon
,
Huh Yunjin
]
I don't want to be so cynical anymore
Don’t be afraid if your heart is beating
So cynical, it’ll be too late if you hesitate
You-you and I are glowing
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum

[Verse 1: Kim Chaewon,
Kazuha

To connect, to be attracted to each other
Promise connecting dots and lines
I won't look back, I know what to do now
I'm looking at you all my life (Ooh, ooh)
[Pre-Chorus: Hong Eunchae,
Huh Yunjin

Rising up heart rate, fast (Ooh, ooh)
Fired up the voice is getting stronger
'Cause something in the air just breathing
Instinct calls, filling my brain

Hong Eunchae

Sakura
]
Our star signs
without fail
My eyes
tell you everything
Blink and you'll wake up
Our star signs in the galaxy
Align the one and only
Born under a special star
[Verse 2: Huh Yunjin,
Kim Chaewon
]
Chasing, chasing following Libra
More like a Cancer there are no limits
Quick like Aries, no looking back slay, slay
And I sting like Scorpio, overwhelming veins, veins, veins (Ooh, ooh)

Align the one and only
Born under a special star
[Bridge: Kazuha,

We ask a question
Why did you get hurt
When you let go all the way around
Our fate, yeah our fate to fight with this cosmo
[Chorus: Kazuha,
Hong Eunchae
,
Huh Yunjin
, *Sakura*]
Our star signs
without fail
My eyes
tell you everything
Blink and you'll wake up
Our star signs

Align

Born under a special star



[Outro: All,

All mine, all mine, all mine
Underneath the starlight
All mine, all mine, all mine

Descend in my heart
You're like CPR
Like Pikachu when I touch
One million volt thunderbolt, it’s pumping
I'm an

Go crazy, that candy's sassy
Renewed the neuronal system
Broke out of the prison in my head

(Galileo)
I put myself on trial, every day
(In my brain)
I was told to go moderately crazy
(Why can't you stop?)
I don't know the six W's, dammit
I'm that material
My answer is, ""Make me super crazy""

Back in the days
The me that fell short of crazy
I will no longer bear false
Witness before my attraction
What it means, what it's worth
What it can and can't do, hush now
Yeah, me and my girls
We know we will go blind, but we still give the sun a kiss, mwah

""I miss my dog so much""
Siro?
I wanna cuddle him just for a little while
You'll see him when you're free, we've got more important things to do
I keep craving greek yogurt
I swear I could live off of it for the rest of my life
But you're allergic
What if you get sick?
*Time sure flies when I crochet*
You've got time for that?
You have so many more important things to do

I can't hide my feelings, I'm gonna say I wanna be loved
But don't you need to earn love?
People won't like it if you say that
I wanna find something I can be passionate about
Something I can go crazy for
Why bother? It's difficult enough doing what everyone еlse is doing
And you probably won't go crazy even if you triеd

So, did things turn out the way we expected?
No, I don't know what's right

I miss my dog so much
I wanna cuddle him just for a little while
Go for it, no matter how hard things are
I keep craving greek yogurt
I swear I could live off of it for the rest of my life
Aren't you allergic?
But you've gotta have some if it makes you happy
What else can you do?
*Time sure flies when I crochet*
Then do it, even if you don't have the time
Cause doing what you love makes you feel alive

I wanna find something I can be passionate about
Something I can go crazy for
I wanna find it, too
'Cause going crazy means you believe in what you love
Don't wait any longer, we're all ready to go crazy

Being true to how we feel, that's who we are

LE SSERAFIM - 미치지 못하는 이유 (Crazier) (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Huh Yunjin,
Kim Chaewon
,
Sakura
]
Wanna go crazy
But it's too late, worried what others might think of me
Another day of
chasing her on the screen
Then it all ends, don't want to let go
It's become a luxury
A movie cliché that I've written in my journal
I was happy back then, free to dream, no strings attached
Now, I ask what all this means
[Pre-Chorus: Hong Eunchae,
All
,
Kim Chaewon
]
Me outside of the square,
who? Who?
What do I like,
are you? You?
The world is too much
I ask myself, ""Are you enough?""
[Chorus: Kazuha]
I'm crazy for feeling more
Jealous of being able to go crazy
'Cause you're in love
[Verse 2: Huh Yunjin,
Kim Chaewon
,
Kazuha
]
Mm
What would you know when you've got everything?
I hesitate at the question and my words trail off
Don't want to let go,
the tip of my childhood dreams
And I know it's not the same, everything's changed at home
Just like the earmarked page of a fairytale
I'm still looking for something
Don't you feel we all lost something?
A dream, a fragrant room
Do you want to knock on the door with me?



[Pre-Chorus: Sakura,
All
,
Hong Eunchae
]
You should ask the more it hurts,
who? Who?
How's your heart,
are you? You?
This racing heartbeat
It's telling you something precious
[Chorus: Kim Chaewon,
Kazuha
,
Huh Yunjin
]
I'm crazy for feeling more
Jealous of being able to go crazy
'Cause you're in love
What's crazier than loving more?
Couldn't go crazy in my youth
Still beautiful
[Outro: Kazuha,
Kim Chaewon
]
If you love something beyond sanity
Someday look back and see
A flower which bloomed
On this field of thorns"

Lyrics from
Teaser
HUH YUNJIN: Hey, girls, you wanna hear something crazy?
Yesterday, I went to the practice room at midnight and it was like really late. You know, just to, like, record some stuff. And then I hear this weird noise coming out from the hallway. And at first, I was like, ""Hmm, that's weird 'cause there should be nobody here at this hour."" So I went out slowly to see anybody was there?

[Pre-Chorus: Kazuha,
Hong Eunchae
]
So where, my where my girls at?
Where my, where my boys at?
Let the reins go loose (Where are my girls at?)
Kim Wan
Sun
, Uhm Jung Hwa,

Crazy girls of the new era
What more should I be afraid of
(Ayy)
[Chorus: Kim Chaewon,
All
,
Huh Yunjin
,
Kazuha
, *Sakura*]
Don't care, now our plan is (
That's my girl
)
Like psychos through the rain we run (
That's my girl
)
Just for today we're going dumb
(
That's my girl
)
We just do it 'cause it's fun
(
That's my girl
)
That’s my girl, that’s my girl, girl
(
That's my girl
)
*I'll solve the problem tomorrow* (
That's my girl
)
*Cut it out, I give your advice half an ear* (
That's my girl
)
Just go and get it, that’s my girl (
That's my girl
)

That's my girl, that's my girl, girl (
That's my girl

[Verse 2: Kazuha,
All

Sakura
,
Kim Chaewon
, *Huh Yunjin*, **Hong Eunchae**]
Does it tie you down, what they think? (
That's my girl
)
No other way than FOMO's path
(
That's my girl
)
Is it too soon or too late?
Are you being chased by laziness, huh
*Just burn your fire, do it now-now-now
Let it go and sing on the road la-la-la*
Hop on this roller coaster ride (**Screaming ha, ha, ha**)
Are you ready to run, where my girls? (
Where are my girls at?
)
[Pre-Chorus: Hong Eunchae,
Kim Chaewon
]
So where my, where my girls at?
Where my, where my boys at?
Let the reins go loose (Where are my girls at?)
IU and Lee Hyori, who's next?
Crazy girls of the new era
What am I more afraid of
(Ayy)
[Chorus: Sakura,
All

Huh Yunjin

Kazuha

Don't care, now our plan is (

Really, I'm honestly just sad about my shoes
Yeah

I like to dance when I party
I like to kiss everybody
Where the heck is Saki?
She's waiting down in the lobby
I'm tryna break it down, yeah, baby,
get her
Turn up the party
I like to dance when I party
I like to kiss everybody
Where the heck is Saki?
She's waiting down in the lobby

Run it back, yeah, I like this track (Yeah), drop it, drop a bag
Louis V bag 'round my neck, ooh yеah, 'cause I'm so classy (Woo)

Hot babe, sweet angel, I'm so cute, I'm so nerdy, so sassy
[Refrain: Kim Chaewon,
Huh Yunjin

Oh, shit, oh, my God
DJ play my favorite song
Raise the roof, let the dogs out
Play something by Beyoncé

Until they kick us to the road
But if they do, it's cool though
Got an address in my phone

LE SSERAFIM - 미치지 못하는 이유 (Crazier) (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Huh Yunjin,
Kim Chaewon
,
Sakura
]
Wanna go crazy
But it's too late, worried what others might think of me
Another day of
chasing her on the screen
Then it all ends, don't want to let go
It's become a luxury
A movie cliché that I've written in my journal
I was happy back then, free to dream, no strings attached
Now, I ask what all this means
[Pre-Chorus: Hong Eunchae,
All
,
Kim Chaewon
]
Me outside of the square,
who? Who?
What do I like,
are you? You?
The world is too much
I ask myself, ""Are you enough?""
[Chorus: Kazuha]
I'm crazy for feeling more
Jealous of being able to go crazy
'Cause you're in love
[Verse 2: Huh Yunjin,
Kim Chaewon
,
Kazuha
]
Mm
What would you know when you've got everything?
I hesitate at the question and my words trail off
Don't want to let go,
the tip of my childhood dreams
And I know it's not the same, everything's changed at home
Just like the earmarked page of a fairytale
I'm still looking for something
Don't you feel we all lost something?
A dream, a fragrant room
Do you want to knock on the door with me?



[Pre-Chorus: Sakura,
All
,
Hong Eunchae
]
You should ask the more it hurts,
who? Who?
How's your heart,
are you? You?
This racing heartbeat
It's telling you something precious
[Chorus: Kim Chaewon,
Kazuha
,
Huh Yunjin
]
I'm crazy for feeling more
Jealous of being able to go crazy
'Cause you're in love
What's crazier than loving more?
Couldn't go crazy in my youth
Still beautiful
[Outro: Kazuha,
Kim Chaewon
]
If you love something beyond sanity
Someday look back and see
A flower which bloomed
On this field of thorns"
