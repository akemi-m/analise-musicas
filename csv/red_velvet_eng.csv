Red Velvet - Cosmic (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Seulgi,
Irene
,
Joy
]
A far-flung star, that funny story (It's electric)
That landing so turbulent
Meeting you as the stars would have it
First star was too cold
So went galaxy-hopping
Into this uninvited crash-landing
A stranger to me, you are, should I ignore you?
I can't get you off my mind
So just to pass time, should I troll you?
[Pre-Chorus: Wendy,
Yeri
,
Irene
]
Hey, what did you do to my mind?
I wanna know you (I wanna know you)
Maybe all night I could throw questions (When the stars align)
You said if the sky's clear tonight
Tomorrow you'll be taking off, but
I got a plan, just you and I
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
]
How about you stay a little longer?
My star tells me she's a bit lonely
Sing this hidden song to you, if you let me
Love is cosmic
I'm riding on your rhythm
Through the solar system, come with me (
Ayy, yeah
)
You and I, crossing the night
Cosmic love, woah-oh



[Post-Chorus: All,
Joy
]
Riding your rhythm
Through the solar system
Wanna know you more
Cosmic love, woah-oh
[Verse 2: Wendy,
Yeri
,
Seulgi
]
Never had this feeling before
Thought about it hard, but, still remains a question mark (
Even this strange ruckus
)
Even to you I'm a stranger
You'd stare like you're seeing an alien
You know that could be hurtful
[Pre-Chorus: Seulgi,
Joy
,
Irene
]
On my star, time flows slowly
You don't have to rush, yeah (When the stars align)
Perhaps we're travelers searching
For orphaned dreams
Shooting stars lost and wandering
[Chorus: All,
Seulgi
]
How about you stay a little longer?
My star tells me she's a bit lonely
Sing this hidden song to you, if you let me
Love is cosmic
I'm riding on your rhythm
Through the solar system, come with me (
Ayy, yeah
)
You and I, crossing the night
Cosmic love, woah-oh



[Bridge: Yeri,
Wendy
,
Joy
]
A striding step towards me
Stretch out your star-tanned hand, oh
""Come with me,"" you say
""Discover things no human eyes have seen,"" you say
I just can't say goodnight
Oh-woah
I can never say goodnight
'Cause your love is cosmic
[Chorus: All,
Joy
]
I'm riding on your rhythm
Through the solar system, come with me (
Ayy, yeah
)
You and I, crossing the night
Cosmic love, woah-oh (
Woah-oh
)
[Post-Chorus: All,
Joy
,
Wendy
]
Leaving tonight
Find the stars hidden from sight (
Oh
)
Let us name them alright
Cosmic love, woah-oh
Riding your rhythm (
Ride this night
)
Through the solar system (
Oh
)
Wanna know you more
Cosmic love, oh, yeah"

[Intro: Wendy]
Hypnotized
You got me hypnotized, ah
[Verse 1: Joy,
Irene
,
Seulgi
&
Yeri
]
Under the sky
Behind the white clouds in my heart
I saw you hiding
Beyond the height that exceeds my stature
An unreachable distance
Oh, my God, oh, my God
You dazzle my eyes, what are you? Oh, my God
Feels like my feet are glued to the ground
Honey, I give you my all
[Pre-Chorus: Wendy,
Yeri
,
Irene
&
Seulgi
]
Look through the gaps between fingers
Love is so blind, especially at night
Even if I can't see, even if it's sad
I'll find you in my dreams
, driving forward
Woah-oh-woah-oh, wait for me
I might melt away in your universe
You got me hypnotizеd
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
,
Seulgi
&
Joy
]
Ooh, wow, feeling so funny
Feeling so fun, fun, feeling so funny
Ooh, I'm loving passionately
Intensely, lovе, love
Loving passionately
You got me hypnotized (
You got me
)
Spinnin' around and round (
So hypnotized
)
Can't move a muscle
Honey, I'm hypnotized when I see you



[Verse 2: Yeri &
Joy
]
Yeah, I knew, yeah, I knew, I expected it
Our worlds are different
Even the pitch-black shadows
Inevitably spread
Pink smoke
[Pre-Chorus: Seulgi,
Irene
,
Wendy
&
Joy
]
At the edge of the sky
The golden sunset that has come (Come, ah)
Disappear, you're an illusion
In my dream, overturning our centuries
(Hey, oh)
Woah-oh-woah-oh, you and me
Flying together all day and night
You got me hypnotized
[Chorus: All,
Seulgi
,
Irene
&
Yeri
]
Ooh, wow, feeling so funny
Feeling so fun, fun, feeling so funny
Ooh, I'm loving passionately

Irene
,
All
&  *Seulgi*]
So don't wake me up
Cross over to the rainbow called dream (
One step, two steps
)
Following your light
Ride through space & time
(*Over space and time*)
Feels like the meaning of love, you
Exist in every moment, around
Summer, autumn, winter, spring
The whole world is you
[Break: Seulgi &
Yeri

Ooh, wow, feeling so funny
Feeling so fun, fun, feeling so funny

Red Velvet - Last Drop (English Translation) Lyrics
[Intro]
Ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
[Verse 1: Wendy &
Joy
]
Like a dazzling night festival
Still vividly remaining, float away
Memories like dazzling fantasies
Ah, tearfully
All the beautiful
Times are leaving me, stealing you away
Shining faintly
Oh, baby
[Pre-Chorus: Yeri]
Every day passing us by
Night and day getting further away
This isn't the end, remember
It was passionately green
[Chorus: All,
Irene
&
Seulgi
]
Let's begin, the last drop for you
You and I, yeah, we never gonna stop
Pour it out generously, the last drop
Giving my all
Burning myself pure white, the last drop
Make it blast 'til the very last time
Shining brightly on you, thе last drop
Giving it all I've got



[Verse 2: Joy &
Seulgi
]
Forever on an unchanging orbit
I will gladly stay by your sidе
Even if everything eventually breaks apart, oh
You make my world go around
Turn it right up when it's down
No matter what form, it's alright
Because in the end, I realize
[Pre-Chorus: Irene]
I'm not afraid in every way
Because it's you who kept me through the long nights
Shining again like a miracle
Embracing deeply
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
&
Yeri
]
Let's start, the last drop for you
You and I, yeah, we never gon' stop
Pour it out generously, last drop
With all my heart
Burn myself pure white, last drop
Make it blast 'til the very last time
Shining brightly on you, last drop
With all my strength
[Interlude: Wendy,
Yeri
,
Irene
,
Seulgi
& *Joy*]
No one knows where a fading star goes
But we can feel each other
And I'll fly light-years to find you (
I'll fly,
I'll fly
)
To you, who made me shine bright
(Shine bright)
In the boundless night
To you, my universe
(*Last drop*)
And the only reason I exist



[Bridge: Wendy]
I'll shine on you with all my heart until the end
[Chorus: Seulgi,
All
,
Joy
&
Seulgi
]
On any night, dazzling brightly
I'll always be here for you
Smiling, meeting again (Ooh)
Like our first time
Remember our last drop
You and I, yeah, we never gon' stop
Moments we'll forever engrave
With all my heart
It'll be another beginning, our last drop
(
To the very last drop
)
Make it blast 'til the very last time
(
To the very last drop
)
Standing at the end of the world's night
With all my strength

Red Velvet - Love Arcade (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Irene,
Seulgi
,
Yeri
,
Joy
]
The arcade, a ring unfolds before your eyes
Before you know it, a strange tension flows through you
Is it real? Is it fake? It's a good play even if you’re confused
Is it love? The count starts right at that moment
Non-stop round, run like crazy
(Oh)
Get a score, more and more, a mission without hints
Continuing to attack, we fall into a dizzying trap
(Oh, no)
I keep getting lost again and reset
(One, two, three)
[Pre-Chorus: Wendy,
Seulgi
,
Yeri
,
Irene
]
I remember the moment I first saw you
In my head, it's game over
You feel the same way, right?
Anyway, it's a meaningless winner
Shall we start together as we were drawn?
Let's go to the top
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
,
Yeri
]
We can't play no game the right way
Time to change everything
(
Do, do you wanna?
)
We can't play no game the right way
Until the end, go high, go high, ah, yeah
[Verse 2: Yeri,
Joy
,
Irene
]
Now, from now on, the key to the game is ours (
Ours
)
Time is infinitely round (Round, round, round)
Choose this next stage
(
Yeah
)
, anywhere is possible
(
Yeah
)
It doesn’t matter what, 'cause, baby, you're my prize



[Pre-Chorus: Wendy,
Irene
,
Seulgi
,
Joy
]
Yeah we won't stop now, customize as much as you like
The obvious course, new record, now everything breaks down
Ready? Everything is ready
(Is ready)
There are no rules
(Make a new stage)
Should we end this boring quest?
Let's go to the top
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
,
Irene
]
We can't play no game the right way
Time to change everything
(
Do, do you wanna?
)
We can't play no game the right way
Until the end, go high, go high
(Ah, ah, ah)
[Post-Chorus: Seulgi,
Yeri
,
Wendy
]
Oh, ba-ba-ba-ba
Finally, the game starts
Break everything down
A free new world
A game without limits just for the two of us
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: All,
Seulgi
,
Yeri
,
Wendy
]
We can't play no game the right way
The important thing is you and I
(Baby, the important thing is you and I)
We can't play no game the right way
As we want, go high, go high
(
Freely, go high
)

Together, yeah
Oh, let's play"

Wendy

It's bright over there
Surprised by a piece of faint light
I fell
A wriggling star
If you grab it, it will overflow
Going up to the sky
If it touches your heart
Echoing throughout the universe
(Each other's sounds)
Even as time goes by
In the same place in each other's hearts
[Chorus: All,
Joy
,
Irene
]
In your sparkling eyes
Touch the starlight contained within
In a world filled with pounding sounds
Things I couldn't say before, uh, yeah
Red cheeks illuminated by the sunset
I want to talk in your ear
[Verse 2: Seulgi,
Wendy
,
Irene
,
Joy
]
The sunlight shining down
It used to pick on us
Laughing loudly
All with mischievous colors
Talk to me and knock on the door
I want to bе with you wherever you go
Following your light
Bеcause all dreams become clearer

I saw the same moon
I want to dream every day
The brilliant light hidden in the shadows
That place we are looking at together
Because it's so shiny

Red Velvet - Night Drive (English Translation) Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh-woah
[Verse 1: Seulgi,
Irene
,
Wendy
,
Yeri
]
Do you see?
Like a shooting star
The signal flare calling us
Shining over the city
That seems to be asleep
A sparkling, dazzling landscape
Even if it steals my heart, it's fine, alright
(Yeah, oh)
The sound of the white moonlight
Will take us back again
(Oh)
A night that feels like
Something amazing will happen
(Oh, yeah)
We're not that young anymore
Try as I feel, it's time
[Pre-Chorus: Joy]
To places not on the map, fly
Like fate, let's roll the dice
[Chorus: All]
Shall we go? Night drive
With you, the night is exceptionally warm
Can't stop
A night wandering as if swimming in starlight
Lightning, thunder
It doesn't matter
We can stay up
Every moment is dreamlike when we're together



[Verse 2: Wendy,
Yeri
]
I still remember
The summer days when I first saw you (Yeah, yeah)
For some reason, I hated the hurried summer sunset
You tell me, ""I'll always be by your side, I promise""
[Pre-Chorus: Irene]
We say, ""Everything has perfect timing
There's no need to search around (Oh)
Believe in us more than anything"" (Believe in us, ooh)
[Chorus: All]
Shall we go? Night drive (Yeah)
With you, the night feels exceptionally warm (Warm night)
Can't stop (Can't stop)
Wherever we are, you lead me like the stars
Lightning, thunder (Lightning, thunder)
It doesn't matter
We can stay up
Every moment is dreamlike when we're together
[Bridge: Seulgi,
Joy
,
Wendy
]
Making eye contact, holding hands
Leaning on each other, ah
'Cause we have all night
Let's go further away
Let's drive tonight



[Chrous: All]
Night drive with you
A night where memories pour down dazzlingly (Pour down)
Let's fly
Way above the stars
Holding you close (Holding you close)
Lightning, thunder (Thunder)
It doesn't matter (Doesn't matter)
We can stay up
Every moment is dreamlike when we're together (Dreamlike)
[Post-Chorus: All,
Seulgi
]
Packed like stars
A kiss on those memories
Saying countless times
I love you (I love you, ah, ah; I love you, baby)
Yeah, at the edge of the night sky
A path still unknown
Wherever it is, we keep going on
We can stay up
Every moment is dreamlike when we're together"

Red Velvet - Last Drop (English Translation) Lyrics
[Intro]
Ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
[Verse 1: Wendy &
Joy
]
Like a dazzling night festival
Still vividly remaining, float away
Memories like dazzling fantasies
Ah, tearfully
All the beautiful
Times are leaving me, stealing you away
Shining faintly
Oh, baby
[Pre-Chorus: Yeri]
Every day passing us by
Night and day getting further away
This isn't the end, remember
It was passionately green
[Chorus: All,
Irene
&
Seulgi
]
Let's begin, the last drop for you
You and I, yeah, we never gonna stop
Pour it out generously, the last drop
Giving my all
Burning myself pure white, the last drop
Make it blast 'til the very last time
Shining brightly on you, thе last drop
Giving it all I've got



[Verse 2: Joy &
Seulgi
]
Forever on an unchanging orbit
I will gladly stay by your sidе
Even if everything eventually breaks apart, oh
You make my world go around
Turn it right up when it's down
No matter what form, it's alright
Because in the end, I realize
[Pre-Chorus: Irene]
I'm not afraid in every way
Because it's you who kept me through the long nights
Shining again like a miracle
Embracing deeply
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
&
Yeri
]
Let's start, the last drop for you
You and I, yeah, we never gon' stop
Pour it out generously, last drop
With all my heart
Burn myself pure white, last drop
Make it blast 'til the very last time
Shining brightly on you, last drop
With all my strength
[Interlude: Wendy,
Yeri
,
Irene
,
Seulgi
& *Joy*]
No one knows where a fading star goes
But we can feel each other
And I'll fly light-years to find you (
I'll fly,
I'll fly
)
To you, who made me shine bright
(Shine bright)
In the boundless night
To you, my universe
(*Last drop*)
And the only reason I exist



[Bridge: Wendy]
I'll shine on you with all my heart until the end
[Chorus: Seulgi,
All
,
Joy
&
Seulgi
]
On any night, dazzling brightly
I'll always be here for you
Smiling, meeting again (Ooh)
Like our first time
Remember our last drop
You and I, yeah, we never gon' stop
Moments we'll forever engrave
With all my heart
It'll be another beginning, our last drop
(
To the very last drop
)
Make it blast 'til the very last time
(
To the very last drop
)
Standing at the end of the world's night
With all my strength

Red Velvet - Love Arcade (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Irene,
Seulgi
,
Yeri
,
Joy
]
The arcade, a ring unfolds before your eyes
Before you know it, a strange tension flows through you
Is it real? Is it fake? It's a good play even if you’re confused
Is it love? The count starts right at that moment
Non-stop round, run like crazy
(Oh)
Get a score, more and more, a mission without hints
Continuing to attack, we fall into a dizzying trap
(Oh, no)
I keep getting lost again and reset
(One, two, three)
[Pre-Chorus: Wendy,
Seulgi
,
Yeri
,
Irene

I remember the moment I first saw you
In my head, it's game over
You feel the same way, right?
Anyway, it's a meaningless winner
Shall we start together as we were drawn?
Let's go to the top
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
,
Yeri

We can't play no game the right way
Time to change everything
(
Do, do you wanna?
)
We can't play no game the right way
Until the end, go high, go high, ah, yeah
[Verse 2: Yeri,
Joy
,
Irene

Now, from now on, the key to the game is ours (
Ours
)
Time is infinitely round (Round, round, round)
Choose this next stage

Yeah
)
, anywhere is possible
(
Yeah
)
It doesn’t matter what, 'cause, baby, you're my prize



[Pre-Chorus: Wendy,
Irene
,
Seulgi
,
Joy
]
Yeah we won't stop now, customize as much as you like
The obvious course, new record, now everything breaks down
Ready? Everything is ready
(Is ready)
There are no rules
(Make a new stage)
Should we end this boring quest?
Let's go to the top
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
,
Irene
]
We can't play no game the right way
Time to change everything
(
Do, do you wanna?

We can't play no game the right way
Until the end, go high, go high

[Post-Chorus: Seulgi,

Oh, ba-ba-ba-ba
Finally, the game starts
Break everything down
A free new world
A game without limits just for the two of us
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: All,

Yeri

We can't play no game the right way
The important thing is you and I

Surprised by a piece of faint light

Oh-woah
[Verse 1: Seulgi,
Irene

Wendy

Do you see?
Like a shooting star
The signal flare calling us
Shining over the city
That seems to be asleep
A sparkling, dazzling landscape
Even if it steals my heart, it's fine, alright
(Yeah, oh)
The sound of the white moonlight
Will take us back again
(Oh)
A night that feels like
Something amazing will happen
(Oh, yeah)
We're not that young anymore
Try as I feel, it's time
[Pre-Chorus: Joy]
To places not on the map, fly
Like fate, let's roll the dice
[Chorus: All]
Shall we go? Night drive
With you, the night is exceptionally warm
Can't stop
A night wandering as if swimming in starlight
Lightning, thunder
It doesn't matter
We can stay up
Every moment is dreamlike when we're together



[Verse 2: Wendy,
Yeri
]
I still remember
The summer days when I first saw you (Yeah, yeah)
For some reason, I hated the hurried summer sunset
You tell me, ""I'll always be by your side, I promise""
[Pre-Chorus: Irene]
We say, ""Everything has perfect timing
There's no need to search around (Oh)
Believe in us more than anything"" (Believe in us, ooh)
[Chorus: All]
Shall we go? Night drive (Yeah)
With you, the night feels exceptionally warm (Warm night)
Can't stop (Can't stop)
Wherever we are, you lead me like the stars
Lightning, thunder (Lightning, thunder)
It doesn't matter
We can stay up
Every moment is dreamlike when we're together
[Bridge: Seulgi,
Joy

Making eye contact, holding hands
Leaning on each other, ah
'Cause we have all night
Let's go further away
Let's drive tonight



[Chrous: All]
Night drive with you
A night where memories pour down dazzlingly (Pour down)
Let's fly
Way above the stars
Holding you close (Holding you close)
Lightning, thunder (Thunder)
It doesn't matter (Doesn't matter)
We can stay up
Every moment is dreamlike when we're together (Dreamlike)
[Post-Chorus: All,
Seulgi
]
Packed like stars
A kiss on those memories
Saying countless times
I love you (I love you, ah, ah; I love you, baby)
Yeah, at the edge of the night sky
A path still unknown
Wherever it is, we keep going on
We can stay up
Every moment is dreamlike when we're together"

What brings you here all sudden?
Crash into a world so still
Chill kill enters like thunder
That thrill be makin' my mind ill
Add sugar to the error,
glory to the incomplete
Could anything scare me? Always and forever
You're so easy to make mine
Held you whenever, sent you wherever

Regretting so bad I could die

What a chill kill, I know you will
Bring me lightning like a winner
Waiting for you here, with a happy ending
What a chill kill



[Verse 2: Seulgi,
Wendy

Yeri,

Night is long, fire up the lighthouse
So you won't get lost (
I'm here

This night is harsh
So the world's all hushed
You tamed me badly
For you there was only me
Why were you so good to me?
Was I worth it, baby?
(Together)
You keep running, running away
Shouting how you hate me
But you couldn't finish saying it
And locked your eyes with mine
(Don't run away)

Nights were young, clumsy, a bit crude
Nights were cold, turn the heat up

Your gaze is drawn behind the slightly opened curtain
A dizzying
dream
(
Get the clue
)
A covered bed
(
Feel like a trap
)
A dawn mist
(
Deep inside
)
Our playground reopened
When day and night change beyond the window
The deepening loneliness is walking dead
I keep wondering more
(
I wanna play
)
The thick darkness falls and leads you to
[Pre-Chorus: Wendy]
Every look is like a mirror
Your shimmering silhouette
The moment that led to mе watching me
[Chorus: All,
Joy

Knock-knock, open up the door
A gamе where we keep wandering around looking for each other
I'm falling more and more into it
It's so bittersweet but I like the chase
Got a devil on my shoulder
A gently whispered voice
Like an angel, come to me
Starting again
Knock-knock, who's there?

Feel each other
Leaving a trace (*Close*)
Chasing and chasing again all night long

When I was caught off guard
When I shoot out, I'm fallin'
Bi-bi-di, bo-bi-di, boo, ayy, oh
I swear to you
I drive it deeper, can't sleep at night
*Feeling drowsy, ayy, oh*
*This spell got, got me trippin' and I like it*

Close your eyes shine and shiver
Your unpredictable timing
The moment I noticed it, already watching me (Hey, ayy)

Knock-knock, open up the door
A game where we keep wandering around looking for each other

Got a devil on my shoulder (

Listen to you

Like an angel, come to me
Starting again
Knock-knock, who's there?

Remember these sensations embracing you now

Oh, dazzlingly bright
The fireworks that once shined
Have vanished from the streets
Darkness is cold
It feels like a veil has been wrapped
Even your warm hands
Feel chilling to the touch
In that moment of hesitation
A strange fantasy unfolds
Snatching you away from me
Like a mean prank

Even if I try to fool you, we'll be fine
Don't forget that it's all a dream, remember

Just a nightmare, nightmare
Only an illusion
Oncе the morning sun kisses us
It all fades away, nightmarе, nightmare

Wake up from this bad dream
I think of us who shined the brightest
It'll all be okay soon

Feels heavier

Go to sleep

After the bitter first encounter
Hidden sweet
Looking forward,
you know
[Pre-Chorus: Joy,
Yeri
]
In my once-empty heart, now filled with ice
Spread it out, you're full of taste, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take a mouthful, it's so cold that it hurts
Even if it freezes
Yeah, I don't care
[Chorus: Seulgi,
Joy
,
Wendy
]
The more I drink you in
All my nights are getting longer
From head to toe
I'm dizzyingly paralyzed, inside me
All my senses
The temperature at that moment that stopped
Oh, this cold and ecstatic feeling
'Cause you make me feel all this fantasy
I want more iced coffee



[Post-Chorus: All,
Irene & Joy
,
Yeri

Fallin' in your eyes
Fallin' in your ice
Yeah, you got me like iced coffee
Got me up all night
Got me up all night
Yeah, you got me like iced coffee
[Bridge: Seulgi &
Wendy
]
Everyday transparently (Everyday, transparently)
Your eyes shine
As if I'm mesmerized by you
Endlessly falling in love
[Chorus: Joy,
Seulgi

Wendy

A delicate tremor (
Ah-ah-ah

Your temperature won't stop
It's cold and it feels more ecstatic (

Red Velvet - One Kiss (English Translation) Lyrics
[Intro: Wendy,
Seulgi
]
One kiss
A trick that captivated you at once
My kiss
Our perfect secret (Ooh-ooh)
[Verse 1: Yeri,
Irene
,
Joy
,
Seulgi & Yeri
]
The thrilling tension, a soaring passion
The closer we get, the more I wonder
Excitement is potion, bold motion
I invite you to my own hideout
I tell you what I like (Oh)
What I want, what I don't, what you got?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
Show me (Yeah)
Gimme some, gimme some
Getting hot
You only get one chance
I want you now
[Pre-Chorus: Seulgi,
Wendy
,
Irene
&
Yeri
]
As if instantly enchanted, love like that
When I let my guard down, just like that
Even the passing glance is thrilling
Your еyes keep flickering
If you get caught, you will miss thе opportunity
Even the initiative will be taken away
You are all obvious
Don't forget, never twice
Baby, take it slow



[Chorus: All]
One kiss
A trick that captivated you at once
You won't forget my kiss
Our secret has become perfect
(Ooh-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la-la-ley)
Almost out of reach, one, two, three
Gonna lose your head, like falling into a swamp
One kiss
A trick that will swallow you up in an instant
(Ooh-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la-la-ley)
[Verse 2: Wendy,
Joy
,
Irene
,
Yeri
,
Seulgi
]
Oh, my God, make eye contact
The way you set my heart on fire (Yeah)
Just one hold your breath (
Go
)
Don't say anything, shh, be quiet
You are so sad
As if in a hurry, dumb, dumb
Yeah, growing bigger
The heart beats, bump, bump
I see you holler, holler
You gotta know
Be different, be different, from now on (
Holler
)
We should go
We should go, watch out
We should go, wanna get wild



[Pre-Chorus: Irene,
Seulgi
,
Yeri
&
Joy
]
As if instantly enchanted, love like that
When I let my guard down, just like that (Hey, hey)
Even the breath that passes by is thrilling
Your hands digging deeper
It will overflow, everything will fall
You won't be able to come to your senses
Like tequila
You're in trouble, protect your heart
Baby, take it slow
[Chorus: All]
One kiss
A trick that captivated you at once
You won't forget my kiss
Our secret has become perfect
(Ooh-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la-la-ley)
Almost out of reach, one, two, three
Gonna lose your head, like falling into a swamp
One kiss
A trick that will swallow you up in an instant
(Ooh-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la-la-ley)
[Bridge: Irene,
Seulgi
,
Joy

Wendy
]
Strange trembling, love that feeling
Losing you (Losing you)
Without anyone knowing tonight
Yeah, a very ecstatic look, love it
As if even reason has been forgotten, lose it
Closer to me, closer to you
Let everything melt



[Chorus: All,
Yeri
,
Irene
,
Joy
, *Seulgi* & **Wendy**]
One kiss
Only one strong attraction
Get ready for my kiss
(*Ah-ah-ah*)
One kiss
A dizzying attraction that cannot be escaped (**Ooh-ooh**)
You won't forget my kiss
The scent deeply engraved on your lips
(Ooh-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la-la-ley)
(
One kiss
)
The bolder it is, the wilder and sweeter it is
Gonna lose your head as if I was trapped
One kiss
A dangerous attraction beyond imagination
(Ooh-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la-la-ley)
One kiss"

[Verse 1: Yeri,
Wendy
,
Joy

Irene

Look, once upon a time
They say that certain actions break the rules
A baddie with a twist
""If you want it, get it"" is my own rule
If you block me, you might get hurt
(Ow)
Bang, crash, oops
You better run
(Ha-ha, ha-ha)
A little naughtier than you expect
(
Ayy
)
Pow, splat, I'm mischievous
Better get out of my way
[Chorus: Seulgi,
Irene
,
All
]
I'm a bulldozer, hurry up when given a chance
Run away, I'm not as patient as I seem
I'm your poet, I'm your pain
Once I start, no way to stop, no brake
I'm a bulldozer, unhesitatingly closer
You'll see me destroy everything
I'm your poet, I'm your pain
If you can't handle it, stop and step back
(

[Verse 2: Joy,
Wendy

Yeri

Never confused about the target
If asked, I won't let go
Because that's me
Easily handle it, handle it
The moment you let your guard down
A whispered growling in your ear
Sorry, you got in my way
[Chorus: All]
I'm a bulldozer, there's nothing after this
Hurry up, I'm not as patient as I seem
I'm your poet, I'm your pain
Once I start, no way to stop, no brake
I'm a bulldozer, closer to the limits
You'll see yourself fall apart
I'm your poet, I'm your pain
If you can't handle it at this point, step back (Ayy)

In the cold wind that shakes you
There were days when I hid
I suddenly feel afraid again
Memories of cringing

But still, I hesitate
I can't miss it
A more wonderful season
Wait for you, yeah
[Chorus: All &

Spread your wings, butterfly
Above the world unfolding before my eyes
The sky opens up to you
Flying high, dazzlingly

I get wet from the rain from time to time
Without any time to do wipe it off
The passing wind may cause you to get bruised at times
It's okay, take a break again, just take it slow
Sometimes the road turns far
Because it's a great trip?
There’s nothing to be afraid of, we’re never losing
Even if I lose you, you'll be found
Don't miss this moment
Don’t regret it
(
Let’s do it right away

Spread your wings again and fly powerfully

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
[Verse 1: Wendy &
Seulgi

These days, all day long
I guess you want to remember
Whenever I get a chance here and there
The graffiti increases and keeps getting all over the place
Even though they seem like obvious scenes
It's special to me
[Pre-Chorus: Yeri,
Irene
&
Seulgi
]
A happy song with you
It's all contained
As if it was always a summer day
Filling up the once picturesque story
(
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
)
[Chorus: Joy & Wendy]
On a pure white paper
Draw every day
The clouds will pass anyway
Trees changing color
A landscape that resembles us
One by one, like a little secret
Just the two of us opened it
So that you can understand



[Interlude: Irene &
Wendy
]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Ooh
Ooh
[Verse 2: Yeri,
Joy
&
Wendy
]
Even if something is a little strange
I don't care
No matter what anyone sees
Is that our day again? (
Yeah
)
Never freezes in the middle of winter
The blue sea
(
Yeah
)
Filling up the summer
(
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
)
Ah, ah
[Chorus: Irene, Seulgi & Yeri]
On pure white paper
Draw every day
The clouds will pass anyway (
Ah-ah-ah

Trees changing color
A landscape that resembles us
One by one, like a little secret
Just the two of us opened it
(
Only the two of us opened
)
So that you can understand



[Bridge: Wendy]
Really sometimes
On a very special day
In the sky
Even if you draw a picture of us standing, I will see it
[Pre-Chorus: Joy]
A happy song with you
It's all contained (Oh)
[Chorus: Seulgi,
Wendy
&
Irene
]
On a pure white paper (
Oh
)
Draw a wish
Clouds hugging each other (
Clouds
)
Trees that lend their shoulders (
Mm

A landscape that resembles us
One by one, like a little secret
Just the two of us opened it
So that you can understand

Your voice lingers in my ears
Your lies (Your lies), your lies (Woo)
[Chorus: All]
Looking at you who only gets angry
Only confirms my suspicions, so I rewind my memory
I was so into it that I always missed it
The gap bеtween your eyes, I zoom, zoom, zoom
You're rambling, talking in circlеs
You broke the alibi into pieces
Your words were sweet, so I always swallowed them
The loophole in your words, I zoom, zoom, zoom

Digging through to find the evidence

I'm a sharp policeman, you're a sloppy criminal

Watch out (Watch out)

I'm thorough (I'm thorough)

Tracking down every trace (Every trace)

Looking at you who only gets angry
Only confirms my suspicions, so I rewind my memory
I was so into it that I always missed it

Red Velvet - Celebrate (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
As if nothing had happened
Close your eyes and blow out the candles
I want to be with you every day
It melts my heart
My secret that you don't know
[Pre-Chorus]
Party is coming to an end
But I want to stay a little longer
I miss the time to go
[Chorus]
It's your birthday
The champagne bursts with you
This cake was sweet all over
Like the first time, I celebrate
Back in the day
Without even noticing
Next to you, before the candle burns
Go back to celebrating
[Verse 2]
Like the invertеd hour hand
I'm the only one who wants to rewind timе
Falling sweetness
It makes my heart flutter when I see you again
Enchanting feelings
I'll never forget everything



[Pre-Chorus]
When everyone stops
I go back to your side
Smiling brightly and making eye contact
[Chorus]
It's your birthday
The champagne bursts with you
This cake was sweet all over
Like the first time, I celebrate
Back in the day
Without even noticing
Next to you, before the candle burns
Go back to celebrating
[Post-Chorus]
I want to be forever, in this dream-like night
Rushing the clock, it's heading toward the end
Back in the day
My heart was sad with regret
I stop and turn back
Start again, celebrate, celebrate
[Bridge]
Put each other in our wide eyes
We'll celebrate through the night
Even if the same scene is new, you and I
We'll celebrate and cross the time



[Chorus]
It's your birthday
Every day is full of you
I turn round and round by your side
Let's be together again to celebrate
Back in the day
Every moment is precious
In this memory that only I know
Celebrate with sincerity
[Post-Chorus]
I want to be forever, in this dream-like night
Rushing the clock, it's heading toward the end
Back in the day
My heart was sad with regret
I stop and turn back
Start again, celebrate, celebrate"

Red Velvet - Marionette (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Cloudless starry night
Moonlight that illuminates the stage
Don't do it tomorrow, it's the time
Feel good, good, good
For whimsical music
I'm moved by my limbs
Beautiful and painful show begins
The curtain has opened
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, you
I can hear the voice in my heart
""Where are you?""
It’s always the same dance
Bored
[Chorus]
The perfect scene I dreamed of
I decided to make it real right now
Cut off the entwined thread
Marionette has begun to movе
Shooting stars are illusions
Only one blink
Look at it with your clear еyes and find it
Dancing to reveal marionette



[Post-Chorus]
It's painful and scary
Confined in a narrow box
(I go) Don't sit down
Let's soar high and high with just one step
(I go) Eventually, it became fun
[Verse 2]
One candle
It's my birthday
Rewritten fate
I'm not going back
The ephemeral colorless show is over
The curtain went down
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, you
Don't hesitate to breathe in
""I'm here""
Even in an unknown place where no one goes
I do not care
[Chorus]
The perfect scene I dreamed of
I decided to make it real right now
Cut off the entwined thread
Marionette has begun to move
Shooting stars are illusions
Only one blink
Look at it with your clear eyes and find it
Dancing to reveal marionette



[Refrain]
Leave yourself in the night breeze
If you dance freely
The moonlight and the stars will be on your side
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
As you like
It's time, slowly
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Do not stop
Don't stop me now
[Chorus]
The perfect scene I dreamed of
I decided to make it real right now
Cut off the entwined thread
Marionette has begun to move
Shooting stars are illusions
Only one blink
Look at it with your clear eyes and find it
Dancing to reveal marionette"

Red Velvet - Wildside (English Translation) Lyrics
[Intro]
Mmm
Show you inside myself
Listen
[Verse 1]
From a sweet melting spot
O-o-o-out
Looking at myself in the mirror
Who are you?
I want to be myself and
Keep dancing without pretending
I look inside me for myself that I don't even know
Baby? Crazy? I don't know the truth
[Pre-Chorus]
I fight even if I know I'll lose
(ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah)
I can't always be running away
[Chorus]
Inside o-o-out my wild side, my wild side
The unseen me who has overcome weakness
Wild side, far away, far away
Higher and higher to the place unseen
No one can stop me anymore
Get set, go
Goodbye, I'm not my old self
Take a look at my wild side



[Post-Chorus]
Wild
Wild
By instinct, do it, come along with me
Let us go down, down, down, down the street
I didn't go anywhere, now I could go everywhere
Scared of change, just looking from the side
When you protect me and I'm breathing
I'm forced into misery like a puppet, muppet
I thought I was no good
But behind weakness there was strength
Words from loveless people, I don't care about it anymore
I will show you the truth
[Pre-Chorus]
Never tell lies to myself anymore
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah)
Fly now to the place I want to be
I'm never scared of going to the sky
[Chorus]
Inside o-o-out my wild side, my wild side
The unseen me who has overcome weakness
Wild side, far away, far away
Higher and higher to the place unseen
No one can stop me anymore
Get set, go
Goodbye, I'm not my old self
Take a look at my wild side



[Bridge]
Accepting myself
That I don't even know of
I want to love more
Believe myself more
So I don't get lost, yeah, yeah, yeah
Starlight, slash the dark night already
So bright, sparkle, la-la-la-la-la
[Chorus]
Inside o-o-out my wild side, my wild side
The unseen me who has overcome weakness
Wild side, far away, far away
Higher and higher to the place unseen
No one can stop me anymore
Get set, go
Goodbye, I'm not my old self
Take a look at my wild side
[Post-Chorus]
Wild

Which do you like?
(He's a big boy)
Let me be clear
(But such a young boy)
Which do you like?
(Such a sappy sappy boy)
Let me be clear know
Come on boy, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
You're sobbing and being pessimistic
You're hesitating again, you can't choose
Writing poems in your note, your hobby is sentimental
Look, now it's time to open the door
[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I definitely wouldn't mind being loved
Why? Stop getting timid on me, amazing
(yeah)
[Chorus]
It's not that I don't like it
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Log out from daydreams
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Which do you love?



I want you to tell me the truth tonight
I'm not a child
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Tell me, which do you love?
Let me be clear
[Verse 2]
It's not bad thing to dream
It's not a fairytale, it's the real world
What are you gonna do? Which one are you gonna pick?
Reality or fantasy, adolescent boy?
I'm still clearing  dating simulation games using the manual
I'm still a long way from real love
[Pre-Chorus]
If I ask you for your love
Don't turn your eyes away from me, amazing
(yeah)
[Chorus]
It's not that I don't like it
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Escape from being just two-dimensional
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Which one do you love?
Tonight let me know your true feelings
You'll really grow up then
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Tell me, which one do you love?



[Bridge]
Which one do you love? Let's make it clear
Which one do you love? Let's make it clear
(Know, know, know, know)
It's fine either way
(Let's make it clear know, know, know, know)

It's not that I don't like it
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Log out from daydreams

What? What? What?

Escape from being just two-dimensional

Is it me or her? Please, choose
In your heart, it's probably me than her
I want you to tell me the truth tonight
You'll really grow up then

These days I'm frustrated, problems piling up

Definitely impossible, getting through barely

As you wish, anything you want, ooh ooh ooh

Put your hand in the cookie jar

Feels like I can fly into a shining world

Next to me is a prince (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Give me) Someone, I want that sweet love

There're more cold wind to come
That day's love is prickling
Colourful coated lovers
Sweet love so sweet love
In the town
Swinging and fluttering
This moment is not not painful
But but but only a little bit but
So it seems, crossing this sky
Sayonara, continuously sparkling
Forever sorry, don't say such things
Wanting to meet you, wanting to meet you
Sayonara, selfish but I love you
If I can rewind the clock's pin
This thought has too many legends
It's raining Lonely night
Tears are Don't know why
Always always
If you're embracing me
Sayonara, laughing more and more
I want to hear your cute laughter
Waiting to see stars after the rain
Sayonara, after such a long time but I need you



Your favourite clothes
With matching rings
Would you come back (x 3)
Tears of that day
Surely unforgettable
Sayonara, continuously sparkling
Forever sorry, don't say such things
Wanting to meet you, wanting to meet you
Sayonara, selfish but I love you
Give me, give me love
Give me, give me, give me love
Give me, give me love
Sayonara give me love
Unbalanced love unbalanced distance
Give me, give me love
Give me, give me, give me love
Give me, give me love

Wanting to meet you
Give me love but Bye bye"

Love is yellow or green?
You know what i mean, right? My dear
There are no right answer to the colors of love
Each of them are different

""Open the secret palette""
An angel is gently whispering to your heart

The canvas deep inside your heart, It'll be okay no matter what you paint on it
[Chorus: Seulgi, Joy]
The futurе will be colorful, I can imagine it
A dream is sprеading like a rainbow
In this abrupt world, Let's repaint it in any colors we like
Show me your color of love

Did you hear it, The sound of a knock on a locked door? Yeah
I'm thinking about you, I'm thinking about you
When the pouring rain in my heart stops
[Pre-Chorus: Joy, (Seulgi)]
I don't care if it's a monochrome sky (Oh ooh)
Let's go out somewhere together, Oh (Oh)

A dream is spreading like a rainbow
In this abrupt world, Let's repaint it in any colors we like

So we can hold each other tight, You know
I want to share my feelings with you forever

[Intro: All]
Rainbow halo
[Verse 1: Wendy,
Joy
,
Yeri
,
Seulgi
]
My fair heart cleared after the rain came
The moment I found you reflected on top of it
A wonderful thing is happening right before your eyes
I was so surprised that I had hiccups
drawn across the sky
The light that's spreading through my heart
How can I see you every time?
Will it be filled with different colors?
[Pre-Chorus: Irene,
Wendy
]
What should I do If I can't stand it without love
When you're overwhelmed with unknown emotions
With both arms full, I feel like I'm hugging you
[Chorus: All]
The place where you fell off with a thud
A picturе drawn by someone
This is definitеly love
Rainbow halo floating on top of it
[Post-Chorus: All]
Rainbow halo dance
Rainbow, rainbow halo dance
Rainbow halo dance
Rainbow, rainbow halo dance
Rainbow halo dance
Rainbow, rainbow halo
Rainbow halo floating on top of it



[Verse 2: Irene,
Seulgi
,
Wendy
,
Joy
]
Somewhat magical and mysterious
Our story is like falling into a Wonderland
It's harder to believe than fantasy like that child
It's perfect, much more than I imagined
Snip-snip, ribbon cut-out tied around my ankles
I hung up on with my arms stretched out in the iron bar
At that moment, it turns into a tall staircase
Following you
(
Yeah, yeah, y-yeah
)
[Pre-Chorus: Yeri,
Seulgi
,
Wendy
]
Pretty words do, I think you're much prettier
It's short but I guess our souls were in sync (
Yeah, yeah
)
It feels like my eyes are whispering quietly
[Chorus: All]
The place where you fell off with a thud
A picture drawn by someone
This is definitely love
Rainbow halo floating on top of it
[Post-Chorus: All]
Rainbow halo dance
Rainbow, rainbow halo dance
Rainbow halo dance
Rainbow, rainbow halo dance
Rainbow halo dance
Rainbow, rainbow halo
Rainbow halo floating on top of it



[Bridge: Seulgi,
Irene

Wendy

Joy

Things like time and emotions
They all have different colors
Mixed, scattered, and filled
Light that drops and falls in the end
Purple dawn, yellow afternoon
We're going to spread to the orange sunset
An yellowish-green and bluish excitement tonight
It's beautiful even if you draw it at first glance
[Chorus: All]
The place where you fell off with a thud
A picture drawn by someone
This is definitely love
Rainbow halo floating on top of it
[Post-Chorus: All]
Rainbow halo dance
Rainbow, rainbow halo dance
Rainbow halo dance
Rainbow, rainbow halo dance
Rainbow halo dance
Rainbow, rainbow halo
Rainbow halo floating on top of it

Wonderland beyond distant memories

We are Queens in the red castle
Don’t need crown, we were born to dazzle
Paradigm that we've been building together
Stereotype that's clearly different
The more you look, the brighter the pose
Problems? Up to the sky
Throw it!
We are makin’ the rules



[Chorus: Seulgi,

Put your hands up higher
The more it gathers, the more beautiful it gets, shining, bling, bling
Even if it rains
Strong and beautiful

We've been waiting for this moment

Red Velvet - Pose (English Translation) Lyrics
[Intro: Seulgi]
Pose just like that, huh!
[Verse 1: Irene,
Yeri
]
The lights are on and I'm on an imaginary stage (up)
Even without high heels
Anywhere on the runway
You know I'm cool
Everybody knows
I opened my eyes
And posed like I wanted, babe
[Pre-Chorus: Wendy,
Seulgi
,
Joy
,
Irene
]
Wow, a bright light is shining on me
Nobody can stop us, no (
Us no
)
Wow, I feel alive
Feel so crazy now
This feeling
Ah, ah, ah,
it's my way
[Chorus: Joy,
Yeri
,
Wendy
]
My two toes rising to the top
A move without any harshness
Phones that get busy looking at me (
Ah yeah
)
Don't pay attention, set us free
I'm my own wannabe
I pose nicely like I'm the main character



[Post-Chorus: All]
In this moment I feel alive
Not getting locked up in this evident frame
I stand up straight
I feel so high
It's the most freeing moment
Meet the real me, yeah
[Refrain: All,
Joy
,
Yeri
]
Pose, pose (
Strike a pose
)
Pose and pose,
yeah!
[Verse 2: Seulgi,
Wendy

Dance like there's nobody around (
Ha

Life is my only stage (
Yeah, yeah
)
Let's go, oh yeah
I'm crazy and I want to enjoy myself in my own way, babe
[Pre-Chorus: Joy,
Seulgi

Wendy

Wow, this new sensation
Even I am surprised
Nobody can stop us, no
(Yeah, yeah, you can't stop us, no)
Wow, I feel alive
Feel so crazy now
This feeling
Ah, ah, ah,
straight away



[Chorus: Yeri,
Irene & Seulgi
]
Two toes rising to the top
A move without any harshness
A pose where you don't know where you're going
Don't pay attention, set us free
I'm my own wannabe
I pose nicely like I'm the main character
[Post-Chorus: All,
Wendy
]
In this moment I feel alive (
I feel alive

Yeah, uh-huh, listen up
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
(Ooh, hoo)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 1: Seulgi,
Wendy
]
Every time I look at the clock
Its hands are pointing to the wrong place
Why are the corners of every chapter in my heart folded?
(Yeah)
[Verse 2: Joy,
Yeri
]
It's the same, but something feels a little weird
Things look very slightly different
This has been a perfect day
But like a cut-out cake
Now one piece is missing
[Pre-Chorus: Irene,
Joy
]
I definitely feel something is different
What is going on? (What’s going on, now?)
I'm confused, my mind is complicated
Oh, the wind blows all over
(Baby, knock on wood)
[Chorus: All]
Wait a minute, here in my heart
An incident that I won't be able to stop on my own is about to happen
(Baby, knock on wood)
After knocking on the tree and chanting a short spell
You may come to me
(Baby, knock on wood)



[Post-Chorus: All,
Yeri
,
Joy
]
Knock knock, knock, baby
(Knock, knock)
Knock knock, knock baby
Knock knock, knock baby
(Baby, knock on wood)
Knock knock, baby
[Verse 3: Yeri,
Irene
]
Ha-Harry Potter like Willy Wonka
(Yeah)
If not that, then Wizard of Oz
(Uh, ha!)
I heard that everything will come true, right?
Then I think now there will be fun
(Hoo!)
[Verse 4: Joy,
Irene
,
Seulgi
]
So that I don’t fall too deeply for you
(You are more to me)
So that I don't lean too much towards you, the center of my world
(Yeah)
To the story that followed me
(Gi-gi-give me some luck)
In an unknown direction
I am strangely flowing to
[Pre-Chorus: Wendy]
I'm shaking, the whole world is dizzy
Oh, the wind blows all over (Baby, knock on wood)



[Chorus: All]
Wait a minute, here in my heart
An incident that I won't be able to stop on my own is about to happen
(Baby, knock on wood)
After knocking on the tree and chanting a short spell
You may come to me
(Baby, knock on wood)
[Post-Chorus: All,
Irene
]
Knock knock, knock, baby
(Oh, yeah, uh)
Knock knock, knock, baby
(Knock knock)
Knock knock, knock, baby
(Uh, uh, uh)
(Baby, knock on wood)
Knock on wood!
[Bridge: Joy,
Wendy
,
Seulgi
]
My breath is passed onto the tree
Small lights wake up, one by one
(Ooh, wah-lah)
(Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa)
Now all I
(Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa)
Need
(Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa)
Is a little luck
(Baby, knock on wood)
So baby, knock on wood
[Chorus: All,
Joy
,
Wendy
]
Suddenly in my day
There's a twist that I never thought would happen
(Yeah, yeah)
(Baby, knock on wood)
After knocking on the tree and chanting a short spell
(Yeah, yeah)
I hope you like me
(Baby, knock on wood)



[Post-Chorus: All,
Wendy
,
Joy
]
(Pa-pa-pa) Knock knock, knock, baby
(Yeah-eah)
(Pa-pa-pa) Knock knock, knock, baby
(Pa-pa-pa) Knock knock, knock, baby

Baby, knock on wood

Red Velvet - Better Be (English Translation) Lyrics
[Intro: Irene]
Better be my baby, you better be
Better be my baby, you better be
Better be my baby, you better be
Better be my baby
[Verse 1: Joy,
Wendy
&
Yeri
]
It's gonna be great
When we hear words when our eyes meet
If you read my thoughts as if they were a book
Then I'm sure we'll be in the same world
Isn't it right? It's between the two of us
Yes, that's right, bеtween the two of us
[Pre-Chorus: Seulgi]
Subtly, under the moonlight
Is this night in which imagination wakеs us up
[Chorus: All &
Joy
]
Come closer to me, carefully
First, better be in love (
Love
)
Well, I chose you
Well, you better be in love (
Love
)
Yet again, tip-toeing, one by one
I'm digging you up
I'm just taking my time
I'll come to you first (Better be)



[Refrain: Yeri]
Better be my baby, you better be
Better be my baby, you better be
Better be my baby, you better be
Better be my baby, you better be
[Verse 2: Irene]
You're hovering around me, hanging around
You keep on giving me something (
Giving me something
), it's annoying
Truth is, my heart just wants to tease you
I'll only express myself to you when I feel like it
[Verse 3: Yeri,
Seulgi
&
Wendy
]
But you're always hugging me
Even if I'm hiding, you find me right away and hug me again
Isn't it right? It's between the two of us
(
Oh
)
Yes, that's right, between the two of us
(
Ooh woah
)
[Pre-Chorus: Joy &
Wendy
]
In the stillness of the early morning (
Entirely
)
When the moonlight fades away (
When everything fades away
)
[Chorus: All,
Seulgi
&
Wendy
]
Be more quiet and get comfortable in my arms
You know it, better be in love (
Love
)
I am only like this with you
Well, you better be in love (
Love
)
Yet again, tip-toeing, one by one
I'm digging you up (
I'm digging you up
)
I'm just taking my time
I'll come to you first (Better be)



[Refrain: Wendy]
Better be my baby, you better be
Better be my baby, you better be
Better be my baby, you better be
Better be my baby, you better be
[Bridge: Seulgi,
Yeri
,
Joy
&
Wendy
]
Let's walk through their day (
With you
)
I follow the scent I know (
To you
)
When the high sun sets (
Like this
)
You come to me every day
Do not rush to reach out to me
I want a real start, I want it, I want it
Better, better, better, better
You better be in love
[Chorus: All,
Yeri
,
Wendy
&
Seulgi
]
Come closer to me, carefully
First, better be in love (
Love
,
woo!
)
Well, I chose you
Well, you better be in love (
Love
;
You better be in love
)
Be more quiet and get comfortable in my arms
You know it, better be in love (
Love
)
I am only like this with you
Well, you better be in love (
Love
)



[Post-Chorus: All &
Wendy
]
Yet again, tip-toeing, one by one
I'm digging you up (
I'm digging you up
)
I'm just taking my time
I'll come to you first (Better be)
[Outro: Wendy &
Irene
]
You better be in love
(
Better be my baby, you better be
)
You better be in love

Better be my baby, you better be

You better be in love

[Intro: Wendy,
Irene
]
You say, ""You're wrong""
I say, ""Alright""
You can still come back to
[Verse 1: Seulgi,
Irene
]
What are you doing? What are you doing? Even if I ask
You don't even answer
Unlike the way you were yesterday
(Unlike it)
Today you are in a cloudy mood
[Verse 2: Irene,
Yeri
,
Joy
]
You act like an angry man
(Check, check it)
Then suddenly become sweet
(Yeah, I knew it)
You change every hour
I'm just
looking
at you who's complex
Now tell me, why you do me like that?
[Pre-Chorus: Yeri,
Wendy
,
Joy
]
Oh my, my (Oh-oh; Oh my)
Just get comfortable
Off your mind (Oh-oh; Oh my, oh my)
I know it's hard for you to give me your heart entirely
Don't worry, I will wait for you
One more time



[Chorus: All,
Seulgi
]
Pushin' and pullin'
(Oh-oh, ooh)
I know how your anxious heart feels
Everybody does
We'll be alright
You can just come to me
Kissin' and huggin'
What else do you need?
Don't be pushing and pulling
You don't have to say anything
You can just come to me
[Verse 3: Joy,

Your scent is colored in the sunset light

The moment our eyes meet again, fall in love
Thank you for waiting for me

Red Velvet - Love Is The Way (English Translation) Lyrics
[Chorus: All]
Whenever I see you I go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But whenever I open my mouth, no, no, no, no, no
I keep doing the opposite, I'm getting confused too
Love is the way, I keep getting lost
I look at you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This isn't how I really feel, no, no, no, no, no
Can you untangle my twisted-up heart?
Love is the way, it doesn't go the way I want it to
[Verse: Joy,
Yeri
,
Irene
]
In front of you I have a cold expression
My lips are pouting like I'm unhappy about something
But that's not how I really feel, hey!
The truth is I like you a lot
[Pre-Chorus: Wendy,
Seulgi
,
]
This feeling of crashing waves is making me dizzy
Even if I try to tell you honestly, it gets tangled up
When I try to avoid your eyes, come one step closer
Oh, my heart says yes, but my lips say no
(
Oh, your lips say no, but my heart says yes
)
[Chorus: All]
Whenever I see you I go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But whenever I open my mouth, no, no, no, no, no
I keep doing the opposite, I'm getting confused too
Love is the way, I keep getting lost
I look at you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This isn't how I really feel, no, no, no, no, no
Can you untangle my twisted-up heart?
Love is the way, it doesn't go the way I want it to



[Bridge: Yeri,
Irene
]
I know, being like this is making me tired too
No matter how hard I try, it doesn't work out
I reflect on it alone at home
But in front of you I do it all again
When you look at me, I get too hot
(
That's right
)
I act like it's nothing
But it stings like being stung by a jellyfish
I'm getting a fever, could it be a cold?
[Pre-Chorus: Joy,
Wendy
,
All
]
My reddened face doesn't match what I'm saying
The reason I don't want you to know I like you
If I take a step back, come two steps closer
I was like an iron wall, but you changed me
(
Oh, your lips say no, but my heart says yes
)
[Chorus: All,
Seulgi
,
Wendy
,
Joy
]
Whenever I see you I go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(
Whenever I see you, yeah, yeah
)
But whenever I open my mouth, no, no, no, no, no
(
But whenever I open my mouth, no, no
)
I keep doing the opposite, I'm getting confused too
(
I'm getting confused too, oh
)
Love is the way, could you wait for me?
(
Could you wait for me?
)
I look at you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
This isn't how I really feel, no, no, no, no, no
(
No, no, no, no, no
)
Can you untangle my twisted-up heart? (
My heart, hey
)
Love is he way, I'll try to become more honest (
Ooh
)
Love is the way, yeah,
could you wait for me?



[Outro: All,

Oh-uh-uh-uh (
Oh, yeah, yeah

Oh-uh-oh-uh (
I do the opposite again
)
Oh-uh-uh-uh (
What should I do?
)
Why am I like this? What can I do?
Oh-uh-uh-uh (
I want to tell you exactly how I feel
)
Oh-uh-uh-uh (
My true feelings are always only about you
)
Oh-uh-uh-uh (
My feelings are going to reach you

I'm already reaching out to you
Reading the waves of your round heart

Write those pretty poems for me
Sing those songs for me

We take it a bit slow (Woo)
I'm matching my steps with you, we are a bit clumsy
Those looks, looks, looks

This touch, touch, touch

You are surprising
From the outside edges, a little slow (Slow)
From the corner of your heart, a little clumsy (Oh)
Those looks, looks, looks

Cold and thick milkshake
The sharp feeling spreads on the tip of my tongue
Make me crazy
I can't see through you, babe
I can't read you
That's why you draw me in even more

The way you speak is nice, that is a hint
You softly push me around
All night, you enter deeper into my heart

The moment I let my guard down you flow in (

My heart flutters because of your sweet gaze (

Irene

Joy

Ah, could you stop with those looks?
Who told you to act like such an adult?
There's bit of a temperature difference between us
Between it all, I was down, down, down
I keep getting afraid I'm afraid, oh
Should I burn it all, throw it all away
Honestly, I'm tempted, I get greedy (
Oh, no
)
But somehow a bit more like us
[Pre-Chorus: Seulgi,
Wendy

Those eyes that look at me
My lips are dried yet again
I get desperate thinking I'll lose you even if I stay still

Woo-hoo, ooh-la-la

Sunny side up!
They say it's easier said than done
You'll end up breaking it if you keep rushing
(
Woo-hoo, ooh-la-la
)
All my boring days are now like Sunday
You are already my sun
Again, again, and again
My heart, my heart, it shrivels up in ashes
Sunny side up!
I can't do it as I want to
I don't wanna break us
(
Woo-hoo, ooh-la-la
)



[Verse 2: Wendy,
Seulgi
,
Yeri

You are too fast, I need time to catch up
I'm not going to take it, your contagious haste virus (Uh)
There's a problem between the way we think
Between it all, I was down, down, down
(
Down, down

My lips are pouting like I'm unhappy about something
But that's not how I really feel, hey!
The truth is I like you a lot

This feeling of crashing waves is making me dizzy
Even if I try to tell you honestly, it gets tangled up

I know, being like this is making me tired too
No matter how hard I try, it doesn't work out
I reflect on it alone at home
But in front of you I do it all again

Red Velvet - Ladies Night (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Wendy,
Seulgi

Hey, this is a moment I've dreamed about a lot (
It feels like a dream
)
With my girls, we know our thoughts
Just by looking at each other, oh
[Verse 2: Joy,
Seulgi
,
Irene
]
Our laughter that piles up like harmony
Wakes up the glittering starlight one by one
The blue wind that reaches our ears
(
Blue wind
)
And the sound of the waves go straight into my heart
[Pre-Chorus: Yeri,
Irene
]
It's been a while
The day where we've all gathered together is today
Listening to each other's stories
Under the darkening sky
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
]
Unforgettable ladies, ladies, ladies night
The stories, stories that pile up
fill this night up to the brim
Ladies, ladies, filled with starlight
Us being together is what makes this night become perfect
[Refrain: Joy,
Seulgi
,
Wendy

Yeri

Only one night, follow the feeling
Put your thoughts away for a while
Only one night, follow me
Enjoy this night that is just like a gift
Oh, ladies night



[Verse 3: Joy,
Seulgi
,
Wendy
]
Oh, this is a perfect moment (
Perfect moment
)
It's too bad that old times have passed, woah, woah
Our memories of each other fit together like a puzzle
Falling into our secret stories with tears and laughter
The temperature of our memories is hotter than the summer
[Pre-Chorus: Irene,
Yeri
]
It's been a while, I wonder if there will be another day
Where we laugh together like this
The trivial deviations we haven't been able to do for a while
Should we do them all today?
[Chorus: All,
Seulgi
]
Unforgettable ladies, ladies, ladies night
The stories, stories that pile up
fill this night up to the brim
Ladies, ladies, filled with starlight
Us being together is what makes this night become perfect

Enjoy this night that is just like a gift
Oh, ladies night



[Bridge: Irene,
Wendy
,
Seulgi
]
Our memories are vividly contained
Inside those shining times eternally (
Eternally
)
I'll keep the feeling of right now
Inside my heart, filled to the brim
(
Inside my heart
)
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
,
Joy
,
Seulgi

Unforgettable ladies, ladies, ladies night (
Ooh

The stories, stories that pile up

Ladies, ladies, filled with starlight (
Oh
)
Us being together is what makes this night become perfect
[Post-Chorus: All,
Seulgi

The party goes on all night
Should we sing our favorite song? (
Louder
)
Under the light of the stars, ladies, ladies (
Ladies night
)
It keeps going until the morning,
a day as cool as this
Us being together is what makes this perfect and meaningful
Enjoy this night that is just like a gift
Oh, ladies night"

Red Velvet - 어떤 별보다 (See the Stars) (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
My heart is pounding again
I can feel your eyes on me
When I look at you
I laugh for no reason
Hey, I guess I like you
[Verse 2]
Can you hear my heart?
Can you see my fluttering heart?
I can’t hide my true feelings
So I’m gonna go to you first
[Chorus]
More than any star
More than that sun
I can't believe you're shining
More important than anything
Do you feel the same?
Do you like me?
Then confess your love to me
My heart
And my days
It's full of you. It's full of you
Do you feel the same?
Do you like me?
If you don't have the courage yet, I'll wait



[Verse 3]
Before I knew it, you bеcame a flower
You’ve grown in my hеart
I'm gonna tell you every day
I’m watering you with my love
It’s a gift of my heart for you
[Verse 4]
Where the hell are you from?
That you make me miss you so much?
If you can always stay by my side
I would be so happy, but then...
[Chorus]
More than any star
More than that sun
I can't believe you're shining
More important than anything
Do you feel the same?
Do you like me?
Then confess your love to me
[Bridge]
What if you don’t feel the same?
With a worried heart
I stay up all night, waiting for your call
You don’t know how anxious I've been



[Chorus]
I am
In my dreams
In my imagination
I always want you to show up
You’re the one I want
Do you feel the same?
Do you like me?
Then confess your love to me
My heart
And my days
It's full of you. It's full of you
Do you feel the same?
Do you like me?
If you don't have the courage yet, I'll wait"

Ah, could you stop with those looks?
Who told you to act like such an adult?
There's bit of a temperature difference between us
Between it all, I was down, down, down
I keep getting afraid I'm afraid, oh
Should I burn it all, throw it all away
Honestly, I'm tempted, I get greedy (
Oh, no
)
But somehow a bit more like us

My lips are dried yet again
I get desperate thinking I'll lose you even if I stay still

Sunny side up!
They say it's easier said than done
You'll end up breaking it if you keep rushing
(
Woo-hoo, ooh-la-la

All my boring days are now like Sunday
You are already my sun
Again, again, and again
My heart, my heart, it shrivels up in ashes
Sunny side up!
I can't do it as I want to
I don't wanna break us
(
Woo-hoo, ooh-la-la
)



[Verse 2: Wendy,
Seulgi
,
Yeri

You are too fast, I need time to catch up
I'm not going to take it, your contagious haste virus (Uh)
There's a problem between the way we think
Between it all, I was down, down, down

Down, down

Cold and thick milkshake
The sharp feeling spreads on the tip of my tongue
Make me crazy
I can't see through you, babe
I can't read you
That's why you draw me in even more
The scent of vanilla is like a reversal
The way you speak is nice, that is a hint
You softly push me around
All night, you enter deeper into my heart

Even if I take just one sip, it's obvious
There's constantly white foam above my lip
Even if I pretend I don't know and hide it, it's you
Ah ooh-la-la-la I like it
Even the milk-colored waves remind me of you
Even if you're ambiguous and vague, constantly
My heart keeps getting bigger, it's you

Ah, yeah, ah, it's a freezing cold taste
Did someone freeze me?

Which do you like?
(He's a big boy)
Let me be clear
(But such a young boy)
Which do you like?
(Such a sappy sappy boy)
Let me be clear know
Come on boy, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
You're sobbing and being pessimistic
You're hesitating again, you can't choose
Writing poems in your note, your hobby is sentimental
Look, now it's time to open the door
[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I definitely wouldn't mind being loved
Why? Stop getting timid on me, amazing
(yeah)
[Chorus]
It's not that I don't like it
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Log out from daydreams
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Which do you love?



I want you to tell me the truth tonight
I'm not a child
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Tell me, which do you love?
Let me be clear
[Verse 2]
It's not bad thing to dream
It's not a fairytale, it's the real world
What are you gonna do? Which one are you gonna pick?
Reality or fantasy, adolescent boy?
I'm still clearing  dating simulation games using the manual
I'm still a long way from real love
[Pre-Chorus]
If I ask you for your love
Don't turn your eyes away from me, amazing
(yeah)
[Chorus]
It's not that I don't like it
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Escape from being just two-dimensional
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Which one do you love?
Tonight let me know your true feelings
You'll really grow up then
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Tell me, which one do you love?



[Bridge]
Which one do you love? Let's make it clear
Which one do you love? Let's make it clear
(Know, know, know, know)
It's fine either way
(Let's make it clear know, know, know, know)
[Chorus]
It's not that I don't like it
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Log out from daydreams
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Which one do you love?
What? What? What?
(Sappy, sappy, too cutie, cutie)
Escape from being just two-dimensional

Is it me or her? Please, choose
In your heart, it's probably me than her
I want you to tell me the truth tonight
You'll really grow up then

There're more cold wind to come
That day's love is prickling
Colourful coated lovers
Sweet love so sweet love
In the town
Swinging and fluttering
This moment is not not painful
But but but only a little bit but
So it seems, crossing this sky
Sayonara, continuously sparkling
Forever sorry, don't say such things
Wanting to meet you, wanting to meet you
Sayonara, selfish but I love you
If I can rewind the clock's pin
This thought has too many legends
It's raining Lonely night
Tears are Don't know why
Always always
If you're embracing me
Sayonara, laughing more and more
I want to hear your cute laughter
Waiting to see stars after the rain
Sayonara, after such a long time but I need you



Your favourite clothes
With matching rings
Would you come back (x 3)
Tears of that day
Surely unforgettable
Sayonara, continuously sparkling
Forever sorry, don't say such things
Wanting to meet you, wanting to meet you
Sayonara, selfish but I love you
Give me, give me love
Give me, give me, give me love
Give me, give me love
Sayonara give me love
Unbalanced love unbalanced distance
Give me, give me love
Give me, give me, give me love
Give me, give me love

Wanting to meet you
Give me love but Bye bye"

You lifted your face and saw at me
You’re still rookie rookie
My super rookie rookie boy
Thump, every time I look I think you’re my perfect type
You’re still rookie rookie
My super rookie rookie boy ha!
Your increasing presence is impossible to doubt
I pretend to keep my composure and laugh, but I’m at my limit
My thoughts stop, frozen
Eventually, I’ll be ice, teeth chattering and monotone
I always think about you
Leading me dangerously, how could you?
Any little things
I always remember, why?
Shaking, my love my love
I cuddle up and walk with you on this road, pretty boy, ha!

Looking looking
I love love that feeling

You’re nice but dangerous
You’re still rookie rookie
My super rookie rookie boy
My heart gets numb
You’re still rookie rookie
My super rookie rookie boy ha!
Hey, you say not to laugh with other guys
You gets mad like you’re my boyfriend
You come to pick me up every morning baby
Are you afraid
Of me meeting a bad new lover? Baby yeah
I like it, your sharp eyes
Not enough? It hasn’t even started yet
What are you waiting for? Don’t make me wait
This way to cuddle and walk with you pretty boy, ha!
I always think about you
It’s confusing, how could you?
Any little thing that happened
Can you remember why?
Shake my love my love
I cuddle up and walk with you on this road, pretty boy, ha!

I love love that feeling (Whoa)

A view spread out between flower petals
You're like a sweet dream
You fly to me, my heart walks on clouds everyday
Fluttering here and there, I met eyes with you
Gently in the wind L-L-Love
Flowers blooming rapidly and strongly everywhere
My heart is pounding L-L-Love
Competitively flying towards me butterflies
I must be flying towards you who’s waiting for me
In this beautiful ecstasy
My heart melts s-slowly
It melts s-slowly
Butterflies butterflies

At your warmth
I sweetly and s-slowly
Melt s-s-slowly
Your white wings, very light
One butterfly lands at the end of my fingers
You suddenly like that
Like a sudden world far away opened for me



One, two petal flies, when our lips meet secretly
I get dyed along with the petals L-L-Love
One bite, two bite, when I'm sweetly filled
My heart is filled as well L-L-Love

Continue to fly towards me and tickle me all day
Never stop shaking my heart
Everyday after meeting you is like a glass bottle filled with sweets
My heart gets sweet just looking at you cra-cra-cra-crazy ah
I take one sniff, I think I’m already drunk
We spread our wings, fly high yeah we fly high



Like I'm hypnotized, I'm drawn closer butterflies
I follow the never ending blue sky

No, deeper
After swimming through my mind
What was that feeling that overcame me?
Its name must be love, right?
[Pre-Chorus: Wendy]
I like that scent that submerged me
I like this feeling, come closer, ah
[Chorus: All,
Seulgi
,
Irene
,
Wendy
, *Joy*]
I’ve already fallen (Oh-oh), silent waves hit
Towards me
, you keep spreading
I jump in
and my heart overflows
A deep echo resounds
It tickles my ears
You fill me up
and my heart overflows
Um, just like this, so good (*So good*), so good to me



[Post-Chorus: Irene,
Seulgi

Yeah (Good)
So, so, so, so good now
(Good)
So good, so good
[Verse 2: Irene & Seulgi,
Wendy
,
Joy

Yeri

You calm an excited me down
Your touch catches me
Like ink, one drop at a time, you spread everyday
Slowly, I wear a deep colour called you
At times, it happens subtly without me knowing
[Pre-Chorus: Seulgi]
The start is not important
Only now that I’m attracted to you, woah-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus: All,
Seulgi
,
Wendy
,
Yeri

I’ve already fallen (
Oh-oh

No, no-oh-oh, oh

A deep *echo* resounds (
Resounds

It tickles my ears
You fill me up

It's overflowing

Um, just like this, so good (
So good
), so good to me
[Bridge: Wendy,
Seulgi

Yeri

Tell me several times
You too, whisper only to me, woah-oh-oh-oh
My head that keeps shaking
Is only filled with you
*I can’t hide it, I want you*
I can’t escape this feeling, it keeps spreading, oh-oh-oh-oh



[Chorus: All,
Seulgi
,
Yeri

Wendy

I give (
Ooh
) myself up to
my heart that’s already fallen
deeply (
Hey, y-yeah

Towards me
(
Woo
), you keep spreading (
Spreading, oh
)
*I jump in* and my heart overflows (
No, no, no, no, no, no

Once again

Again, your breaths, oh

They tickle my ears
You fill me up
(*Oh-woo*) and my heart overflows (**It overflows, oh**)
Just like this, so good,
so good to me

Red Velvet - 멋있게 (Sassy Me) [English Translation] Lyrics
A-ha
Ooh I love this
Booh coolly
Yes, OK?
Do as I want so sassy me
Quick step on the beat
All looks gather on me
Everywhere I step runway
They can’t hate me, don’t be surprised
This is just the start
I can do anything, inside me is the universe
When the sun wakes up, the world is mine
Dingy dangy diggy
Don’t you know (I’m sassy, too sassy)
Dingy dangy diggy
As I want (I can definitely be rougher)
Oh don’t be scared
You’re strong Ooh ooh (I’m on another level)
Burn it up coolly
Burn it up coolly
I touch my sky I look straight
Don’t meddle with your meaningless words
Can you move? I’m busy
I’m so on fire
I’m working hard like fire
With that, I’m number one



Tonight (Tonight) With the stars (The stars)
And the moon (The light) When they all shine for me
I want to make a new destiny for me
Dingy dangy diggy
Don’t you know (I’m sassy, too sassy)
Dingy dangy diggy
As I want (I can definitely be rougher)
Oh don’t be scared
You’re strong Ooh ooh (I’m on another level)
Burn it up coolly
Burn it up coolly
I’m going to follow my time
I won’t be shaken, I trust myself
Because I’m this hot (I won’t stop)
I go as I want I’m doing me
Shhh.. Did you hear that? Whoa!
Dingy dangy diggy
Don’t you know (I’m sassy, too sassy)
Dingy dangy diggy
As I want (I can definitely be rougher)
Oh don’t be scared
You’re strong Ooh ooh (I’m on another level)
Burn it up coolly
Burn it up coolly



Ttururuh ttururuh
Ttururuh ttururuh
Ttururuh ttururuh (Ok, alright)

Red Velvet - Taste (English Translation) Lyrics
There are many different tastes in the world
But you know what? Um.. Listen!
I hesitate in front of the vending machine
The same worry for ten minutes
There's so much I want to taste (question mark)
I won’t know them until I drink them (Whoa whoa)
A sweet coffee?
Or maybe just strawberry milk?
(Ooh time for a decision)
There's so many sweet temptations in the world
Look if your choose the right (Again, I)
The left looks tastier (Again, I)
The seesaw inside my heart is busy (it moves)
Even now Oh
First time meeting this taste
Taste taste taste taste taste
Within the numerous different selections
(I don't want to ponder)
Didn’t expect this taste
Taste taste taste taste taste
I like tastes that take me by surprise (want to enjoy it)



Sometimes I have a dream (listen to me, shh!)
Like a family in a sitcom, I wish my life would be
(Yeah everyday everyday)
Filled with something new everyday (all the time)
I want lots of exciting events (like a comedy movie pa-ha!)
The sun kissing my skin
Walking along a comfortable path
A peaceful outing
That's not bad, but I like adventures too
Look the minute I open a day (I look again)
A new flavor everyday (I look again)
There are days where the fizz is gone (So so so what)
What's wrong about it? Oh
First time meeting this taste
Taste taste taste taste taste
Within the numerous different selections
(I don't want to ponder)
Didn't expect this taste
Taste taste taste taste taste
I like tastes that take me by surprise (want to enjoy it)
Hold up! I take out my phone and look through my gallery
A hashtag that's unnecessary for us
What's wrong with different, who says what?
Even when they whisper, go “whatever”



Every night where I would ponder and worry
Even if I don't want it to bother me I can’t stop
Keep it on, ou don’t have to worry, don't stop
What’s the flavor you have in your can?
So what? What you think
You're the most natural being you
Sugarcoated words are bad for you
Smile and say hello to the world
I hope today makes you want to anticipate tomorrow
The one I chose, this taste
Taste taste taste taste taste
In a few seconds, it'll take over my lips
(Looking forward to it, my heart is thumping)
Something is changing my days
Days days days days days
Whichever path I take, it's still me (OK)
Waiting for me this taste
Taste taste taste taste taste
You can regret it after you taste it
I want be new every day
Every day every day (OK)"

Filling up my heart to the brim

I hear a bell, I hear a bell in my head
It must be your voice
Even that red lighthouse afar
*Looks like a Christmas tree
And I want to make a wish*

It’s late but here I am, sighing by myself
Look what you’ve done, you’ve got my heart going crazy, oh
Baby baby baby baby baby you
Play me play me play me play me play me
Your sparkling gaze has me so dizzy
My calm and collected intuition’s nowhere to be found, oh
Baby baby baby baby baby you
Crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy (Crazy yeah)
I’m like a mannequin
Just looking at you
Turns me into a cringey mess (Ha ha ha)
No one can stop me
From dancing with awkward steps



My stiff facial expressions

Hold on a sec, I wasn’t expecting this
Things have been happening so fast since the day I met you
You see right through me, ready to start at a moment’s notice
Don’t know why I can’t read the vibe, the border’s so unclear
I had my hopes up but you just keep teasing me
Boy, you can’t feel me
I’m here next to you, hesitating
You smile, and before I know it I lose control
That was when I went numb, you’ll be my sweet love



Never apart, whether we’re asleep or awake
Walking a fine line between loving and hating you
I stand on my tiptoes with all my might
[S]/[W] but you treat me like a little kid again, oh
I’m just like a robot
Rigid because I need some oil (Ha ha ha)
I can’t move (Can’t) my body (Body)
It’s almost like I’ve forgotten how to breathe
My stiff facial expressions (Oh no)

La-la-la-la-la~
I’ve got a crazy secret to tell you, covered by a veil
Things are getting more intense so h-h-hush, I’m taking aim
The darkness of night sets in around me
It’s so dark even the shadows get lost
Oh my dear, you always say “love is game”
Is this a trivial game to you?
Why are you changing the topic
By saying something mean?
My heart b-b-beats loud in my chest
Your heart b-b-b-beats too
It’s a little unusual
Until the very end
Things will just keep getting more crazy
I’ve really got my aim on you, russian roulette
Ah-ah-ah-yeah
La-la-la-la-la~ (A little more)
Heart b-b-b-beat
Until the very end
It all depends on me now
Your russian roulette



Sparkling secret, I’m at my limit, I can’t ignore it
P-p-p-push the button, just accept already
That I’ve filled your heart
Even between dreams
Oh, now “love is game”
You still say, but your voice is shaking
You can joke around and look away
But I know you’re hesitating
My heart b-b-beats loud in my chest
Your heart b-b-b-beats too
It’s a little unusual
Until the very end
Things will just keep getting more crazy
I’ve really got my aim on you, russian roulette
Ah-ah-ah-yeah
La-la-la-la-la~ (A little more)
Heart b-b-b-beat
Until the very end
It all depends on me now
Your russian roulette
You’ve never experienced a dream like this, have you?
This love and the night
Start moving, game you can’t control



My heart b-b-beats loud in my chest
Broken heart b-b-b-beat
Don’t pass the key
Until the very end
Things will just keep getting more crazy
I’ve really got my aim on you, russian roulette
Ah-ah-ah-yeah
La-la-la-la-la~ (A little more)
Heart b-b-b-beat
You’re in so deep that you can’t escape
I’ll hit you directly in the heart, russian roulette

Let’s fly up high, you’ve got wings, right?
My boy, you’re going to be late
[S]/[W] And you’re completely oblivious to
My hidden love for you



Pop pop popping up, sweet honey (Honey, yeah)
That juicy red strawberry mix up (Juicy red strawberry mix up)
This candy shop is open, baby (Yeah-eh-eh)
Drink up the red flavor that tastes like love (Yeah)
Our happy, cheerful everyday goes boom
Like a field of flowers, it blooms (RED)
Candy girl, cookie girl, chocolate girl
Let’s open your mouth (RED)
Bet you wanna bet you wanna dance like this
Everyone likes sweet things
When I’m with you, chew chew, yummy-gummy
Let’s shout out our favorite color
Say RED RED, ah
A dream soaked into my body
Sugar cream melting and running
In your soft ice-cream
There are colorful jelly beans
Oh my sweet baby (Oh my sweet baby)
Oh my sweet baby (Oh my sweet baby)
My swelling feelings
Drink up the red flavor that tastes like love (Red flavor)
Pop pop popping up, sweet honey (Honey)
That juicy red strawberry mix up (Strawberry mix up)
This candy shop is open, baby
Drink up the red flavor that tastes like love (Up the red flavor that tastes like love)



I want you to surround me with your sweet love"

Red Velvet - Bad Boy (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Irene,
Seulgi
]
Who dat, who dat, who dat boy?
In a crowd of people, you stand out
I see your nonchalant expression, I like that
It sparks my curiosity
[Refrain 1: Yeri,
Joy
]
Oh, your edgy style is a bonus
Looking like you threw on some clothes
How you talk so disinterested, I like that
Even if I try to ignore it, I'm drawn to you
[Pre-Chorus: Wendy]
You're different, I'm haughty but you make me laugh
You know that lately, I'm hot, ah-ah
Can you feel the eyes on me?
[Chorus: Joy, All]
Follow me like you're under a spell
Everyone's cheering, and soon, you'll be too, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Even if you pretend not to, you will, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Should we make a little bet?
[Post-Chorus: Seulgi, All, Irene]
Don't come to me so easily
That's no fun, stay there, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Let's push and pull, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
I'll start, bad boy down



[Hook: All, Wendy]
Whoa, whoa
From now, bad boy down
Whoa, whoa
[Verse 2: Yeri, Wendy]
Come here for a second, I have something to say to you
Come a little closer, lower your head to my height
Forget about everything else
Focus on my voice
[Refrain 2: Irene, Joy, Seulgi]
Things are changing now
You're wondering as I revolve around you
You'll find out too (What is it?), you'll know (Say it)
That it's already too late
[Pre-Chorus: Seulgi]
Yeah, I'm actually really confident
I don't play games I'll lose, ha-ah-ah
You've already halfway fallen for me
[Chorus: Joy, All]
Follow me like you're under a spell
Everyone's cheering, and soon, you'll be too, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Even if you pretend not to, you will, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Should we make a little bet?



[Post-Chorus: Joy, All]
Don't come to me so easily
That's no fun, stay there, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Let's push and pull, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
I'll start, bad boy down
[Bridge: Wendy, Joy, Seulgi, Irene]
You must be confused, you never saw this coming
Try all you want, but there's no way out
The answer's already set, you'll follow me naturally
I choose you, I already chose you
[Chorus: Joy, All]
Follow me like you're under a spell
Everyone's cheering, told you so, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
The result is always the same, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
See? I won again
[Post-Chorus: Joy, All]
Don't come to me so easily
That's no fun, and now, you, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Can't escape me, ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
It's easy to me, bad boy down"

You know when you're worrying all day

You brush my unruly hair back

Ah, shall we begin, how I've waited this time to love

Like sparkling lights (In your eyes)

Should I start speaking informally?
Should I softly grab your arm?
Should I close my eyes for a moment?

I already showed you my best outfit
I keep getting more and more worried
You still haven't told me your favorite movie
I still have so much to ask
Should I be more aggressive?
What if you get scared and run away?
From A to Z, it's all so awkward
Dumb, dumb

Tick tock, stop time, time
My heart keeps pounding
I can't lose the third date
What do I do? My second date

Locking lips, too early?
Right? No, you never know
At first, I closed one eye
I wanna close both eyes today

[Verse 1: Seulgi,
Joy
,
Wendy

Sometimes, I tell you
That love is still hard for me
Then you just
(
Slightly
)
look at me and
(
Smile
)
Without a word, you warmly hold my hands
[Pre-Chorus: Irene,
Yeri
,
Wendy
]
It's strange, when I'm with you, when it's just us two
Things that aren't a big deal
Things you didn't even ask about, I say it all
Just by listening to my stories
Makes me feel like you're forever on my side
[Chorus: All]
If I say your name
It feels like I'm saying I love you
I can't hide it, my heart pounds
I call and call out to you but it's like that every day
Looking at each other right now
Feels like love
I wish time would stop for just us two
[Verse 2: Joy,
Irene
,
Wendy
]
Sometimes, I meet my friends and go places
I eat good food and it makes me happy
But I keep thinking about you, right, so I take pictures, take
Swearing that I'll come here with you next time (
That's right
)
Whatever we talk about
I keep showing off about you
Even when we are apart
Two of us, always, two of us
Feels like you're next to me even now



[Pre-Chorus 2: Wendy,
Joy
,
Seulgi
,
Yeri
]
When tears fall at the end of a tiring day
Without a word, you lend me your shoulders
When you hug me like my dad
It makes me feel like you're forever on my side
[Chorus: All]
If I say your name
It feels like I'm saying I love you
I can't hide it, my heart pounds
I call and call out to you but it's like that every day
Looking at each other right now
Feels like love
I wish time would stop for just us two
[Bridge: Seulgi,
Yeri
,
Wendy
,
Irene
]
Sometimes, I'm surprised
How can we be thinking the same thoughts
All the time?
Honestly, I thought about this sometimes
Maybe we're the same person
Or else how can you explain all of this?
[Chorus 2: All,
Wendy
,
Yeri
,
Seulgi
]
I keep smiling when I see you (
All my love
)
I know this is love (
Hoo
) (
Come on
)
Our hands are on top of each other (
Your love
)
I feel your heart (
My love, oh
)
Without missing anything (
Oh-oh
)
Now, I'll show you how much my love has grown (
Hey, boy
)
It's nothing special but I wanna fill myself with you alone



[Chorus: All,
Irene
,
Joy
,
Wendy
, *Seulgi*]
If I say your name (
My boy, my boy
)
It feels like I'm saying I love you (
Yeah, boy

I can't hide it, my heart pounds (
My love

I call and call out to you (
Every day

(
My boy

Looking at each other right now (
Ooh

Feels like love (

[Verse 1: Joy,
Yeri

It was especially bright
On that night, when my heart fluttered so much
Felt like you'll notice
So I kept stepping backwards
[Pre-Chorus: Irene]
Suddenly, I heard the sound of bells
Coming from somewhere
[Chorus: Seulgi,
Wendy
]
Is it the moon?
Was it shining on us and did it want to say something?
I've never heard it before
That unforgettable sound of the moonlight
[Verse 2: Irene,
Joy
]
Sometimes, no many times, I think of that night
Feels like you can hear my heart
So I'm closing the windows
[Pre-Chorus: Yeri]
I suddenly remembered so I smiled
The sound of the bells in my ears
[Chorus: Wendy,

Is it the moon?
Was it shining on us and did it want to say something?
I've never heard it before

Do you remember?
It sang for us, it blessed us
Out of the many stars
It was the biggest and brightest

I tune my ears but I can't hear it anymore
The precious and unforgettable sound of the moonlight"

[Post-Chorus: All]
My second date
My second date
[Verse 2: Seulgi,
Wendy
,
Irene
]
Heart is pounding, I rehearsed all last night
Just like I practiced, slowly, 1, 2, 3
I have so many things on my wish list
I'm sure a kiss is still a dream
Heart is pounding, slowly, 1, 2, 3
[Pre-Chorus: Yeri,
Joy
]
Tick tock, stop time, time
My heart keeps pounding
I can't lose the third date
What do I do? My second date
[Chorus: All]
Should I start speaking informally?
Should I softly grab your arm?
Should I close my eyes for a moment?
Today is my second date
[Post-Chorus: All]
My second date
My second date



[Bridge: Yeri,
Irene
]
As if I didn't know, as if it was a mistake
Should I trip and fall, grab your arm?
Should I wait a little more?
Nothing changed from the first date
Locking lips, too early?
Right? No, you never know
At first, I closed one eye
I wanna close both eyes today
[Break: Joy,
Seulgi
,
Yeri
,
Wendy
]
I couldn't do anything and only time passes
I couldn't do anything and only time passes, baby
I couldn't do anything and only time passes
Tick tock, tick tock
I couldn't do anything and only time passes, baby
[Chorus: All,
Wendy
]
Should I start speaking informally?
Should I softly grab your arm?
Should I close my eyes for a moment?
Today is my second date (
Ooh, yeah
)
[Post-Chorus: All]
My second date
My second date
My second date
My second date"

One, two, one, two, come here
I'll cut to the chase

Let's go, let's go, there are many paths

Check it out, so our hearts won't get confused
Farther than any limit you know
I can go, I will shout out
Use your feet, we came so far

Light, camera, action, uh
Everything is perfect

Red Velvet - About Love (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Seulgi,
Joy
,
Wendy
]
Sometimes, I tell you
That love is still hard for me
Then you just
(
Slightly
)
look at me and
(
Smile
)
Without a word, you warmly hold my hands
[Pre-Chorus: Irene,
Yeri
,
Wendy
]
It's strange, when I'm with you, when it's just us two
Things that aren't a big deal
Things you didn't even ask about, I say it all
Just by listening to my stories
Makes me feel like you're forever on my side
[Chorus: All]
If I say your name
It feels like I'm saying I love you
I can't hide it, my heart pounds
I call and call out to you but it's like that every day
Looking at each other right now
Feels like love
I wish time would stop for just us two
[Verse 2: Joy,
Irene
,
Wendy
]
Sometimes, I meet my friends and go places
I eat good food and it makes me happy
But I keep thinking about you, right, so I take pictures, take
Swearing that I'll come here with you next time (
That's right
)
Whatever we talk about
I keep showing off about you
Even when we are apart
Two of us, always, two of us
Feels like you're next to me even now



[Pre-Chorus 2: Wendy,
Joy
,
Seulgi
,
Yeri
]
When tears fall at the end of a tiring day
Without a word, you lend me your shoulders
When you hug me like my dad
It makes me feel like you're forever on my side
[Chorus: All]
If I say your name
It feels like I'm saying I love you
I can't hide it, my heart pounds
I call and call out to you but it's like that every day
Looking at each other right now
Feels like love
I wish time would stop for just us two
[Bridge: Seulgi,
Yeri
,
Wendy
,
Irene
]
Sometimes, I'm surprised
How can we be thinking the same thoughts
All the time?
Honestly, I thought about this sometimes
Maybe we're the same person
Or else how can you explain all of this?
[Chorus 2: All,
Wendy
,
Yeri
,
Seulgi
]
I keep smiling when I see you (
All my love
)
I know this is love (
Hoo
) (
Come on
)
Our hands are on top of each other (
Your love
)
I feel your heart (
My love, oh
)
Without missing anything (
Oh-oh
)
Now, I'll show you how much my love has grown (
Hey, boy
)
It's nothing special but I wanna fill myself with you alone



[Chorus: All,
Irene
,
Joy
,
Wendy
, *Seulgi*]
If I say your name (
My boy, my boy
)
It feels like I'm saying I love you (
Yeah, boy
)
I can't hide it, my heart pounds (
My love
)
I call and call out to you (
Every day
)
(
My boy
) But it's like that every day
Looking at each other right now (
Ooh
)
Feels like love (
Come on
)
I wish time would stop for just us two (*Oh-whoa, yeah*)
[Outro: Joy,
Wendy
]
(Yeah)
Oh-oh
(I like you)
My boy"

Red Velvet - 달빛 소리 (Moonlight Melody) (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Joy,
Yeri
]
It was especially bright
On that night, when my heart fluttered so much
Felt like you'll notice
So I kept stepping backwards
[Pre-Chorus: Irene]
Suddenly, I heard the sound of bells
Coming from somewhere
[Chorus: Seulgi,
Wendy
]
Is it the moon?
Was it shining on us and did it want to say something?
I've never heard it before
That unforgettable sound of the moonlight
[Verse 2: Irene,
Joy
]
Sometimes, no many times, I think of that night
Feels like you can hear my heart
So I'm closing the windows
[Pre-Chorus: Yeri]
I suddenly remembered so I smiled
The sound of the bells in my ears
[Chorus: Wendy,
Seulgi
]
Is it the moon?
Was it shining on us and did it want to say something?
I've never heard it before
That unforgettable sound of the moonlight



[Bridge: Joy,
Wendy
]
Do you remember?
It sang for us, it blessed us
Out of the many stars
It was the biggest and brightest
[Chorus: Seulgi,
All
]
Every day, I'm at that place
I tune my ears but I can't hear it anymore
The precious and unforgettable sound of the moonlight"
