Cosmic,2024,Cosmic,"Lonely star, that funny story
(It's electric)
That noisy landing
The strange incident of meeting you
The first star is cold
Crossing several galaxies
Landing randomly
Should I abandon you, the unfamiliar stranger?
Honestly, I'm too worried
Should I tease you for fun?
Hey, what did you do to my mind?
I'm curious about you (I'm curious about you)
I might ask questions all night long
(When the stars align)
If tonight is clear
You say you'll leave tomorrow
I got a plan, just you and I
How about staying a little longer?
My star feels a bit lonely
I'll play you the cherished song
Love is cosmic
I'm riding on your rhythm
Through the solar system
Come with me
The two of us crossing this night
Cosmic love
Riding your rhythm
Through the solar system
I want to know you more
Cosmic love
These feelings are new
Even after thinking deeply, it's a question mark
This unfamiliar commotion
I might seem strange to you too
Like an alien you used to see
I might get hurt
The time of my star flows slowly
You don't have to rush
(When the stars align)
Maybe we are travelers
Looking for ownerless dreams
A small wandering meteor
How about staying a little longer?
My star feels a bit lonely
I'll play you the cherished song
Love is cosmic
I'm riding on your rhythm
Through the solar system
Come with me
The two of us crossing this night
Cosmic love
You come closer
Reaching out your burnt hand
Let's leave together
Let's find things we haven't seen
I just can't say goodnight
I can never say goodnight
'Cause your love is cosmic
I'm riding on your rhythm
Through the solar system
Come with me
The two of us crossing this night
Cosmic love
Tonight, let's leave
Find hidden stars
I'll give them names
Cosmic love
Riding your rhythm
(Riding this night)
Through the solar system
I want to know you more
Cosmic love, oh, yeah"

Chill Kill - The 3rd Album,2023,Chill Kill,"Ooh
Ooh, oh
Where did you come from suddenly
The crash of the quiet world
The appearance of Chill Kill is like thunder
I went crazy with that thrill
Praise the sweetness of the incomplete error
What were you afraid of? Always and forever
You were too easy, you were mine
I hugged you as I pleased and sent you off coolly (ooh)
I miss you again
Regretting to death
Yeah, don't care if it hu-hu-hurts
The perfect soul that suits you
Can I hold onto you again?
(Hey) don't think about tomorrow
(Yoo-hoo) You still shine brightly
It will change now
Tears flow, melting the ice
What a chill kill
I know you will
Bring me lightning
Like a winner
I'm waiting for you here
To a happy ending
What a chill kill
Light the lighthouse on the long night
So you don't lose your way (I'm here)
It's a harsh night
The whole world holds its breath
You tamed me wrong
You only knew me
Why did you do so well?
Do I deserve it? (together)
You keep running far away
Shouting that you hate me
You hesitated at the end of those words
You looked into my eyes (don't run away)
Rough and awkward nights were young
Let's warm up the cold night
Yeah, look, look, I've changed a lot
I've changed quite a bit
Can I hug you once more?
(Hey) don't think about tomorrow
(Yoo-hoo) You still shine brightly
It will change now
Tears flow, melting the ice
What a chill kill
I know you will
Bring me lightning
Like a winner
I'm waiting for you here
To a happy ending
What a chill kill
Say, say, say
Now, are you ready, ready? (You ready?)
Say, say, say
Now, are you ready?
Because of you (because of you)
I don't cry, ah-ah-ah
Because of you (because of you)
I could only smile (up in the sky)
Yeah, it's love
The orange sun is almost setting
I only need your warmth
Until the end (till the end of time, yeah, yeah)
End of time
(Hey) don't think about tomorrow
(Yoo-hoo) You endlessly shine (oh, yeah, yeah)
It will change now
Tears flow, melting the ice
Don't think about tomorrow (oh, yeah)
Forget about your sorrow (oh)
It will change, you can't leave me
Tears flow, melting the ice (melting the ice)
Don't think about tomorrow
You endlessly shine
It will change, now it's my turn"

Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
The sound of the wind behind the closed door
Your gaze beyond the drawn curtain
Dizzy dream (get the clue)
Covered bed (feel like a trap)
Early morning mist (deep inside)
Our playground reopened
When day and night change beyond the window
The deepening loneliness is walking dead
I'm more curious (I wanna play)
The thick darkness descends and leads you
Like a mirror in every gaze
Your flickering silhouette
The moment connected to me watching me
Knock-knock, open up the door
Continuously searching for the lost game
Gradually falling into it
It's so bittersweet but I like the chase
Got a devil on my shoulder
Whispering voice softly
Like an angel approaching you
Starting again
Knock-knock, who's there?
I'm with you
Feeling each other
Leaving traces (close)
Chasing and being chased all night (run away)
In a moment of carelessness
When I shoot out, I'm fallin'
Bi-bi-di, bo-bi-di, boo, ayy, oh
I swear to ya
Going deeper, can't sleep at night
Feeling sluggish, ayy, oh
This spell got, got me trippin' and I like it
Close your eyes, shine and shiver
Your unpredictable timing
The moment I realized already watching me (hey, ayy)
Knock-knock, open up the door
Continuously searching for the lost game
Gradually falling into it
It's so bittersweet, but I like the chase (it's so bittersweet)
Got a devil on my shoulder (right here)
Whispering voice softly (listen to you)
Like an angel, approaching you
Starting again
Knock-knock, who's there?
W-wow
The moment the door opens, another door
N-now
I'm more confused about your heart
My heart
The more you come in, you want it more
Knock-knock (yeah)
Knock-knock, open up the door
Our game that we can't escape from (eh-eh)
Deeply luring
It's so bittersweet, but I like the chase (oh)
Got a devil on my shoulder
Sweetly smiling voice (oh)
Going round and round all night
You're trapped in my dream
Knock-knock, who's there?
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh (knock-knock)
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh (ah)

Chill Kill - The 3rd Album,2023,Underwater,"Yeah, all I need for you's to stay
And forever, you will sway
They can’t love you like I love you
Quickly disappear, all those waves
Without leaving any trace
Or becoming something that never existed from the start
Very deep underwater
Now you can open your eyes
Completely wrapped around you
Only you are allowed here
I remember the sensations
That are surrounding me now
So you can take your time
Oh, unfamiliar warmth trembling
It's all you, you-ooh
The emotions that wake you up
All of them true
I can't wait, babe
What’s it gonna be?
What's it gonna be, babe?
You should show me
You're deeply locked in me
Filling my heart completely, babe, overflowing
You can entrust yourself to be led by gravity
You make me want you more (oh)
Quietly flowing in, seamlessly
Being able to breathe inside me, oh
Who can love you like I love you?
This warm and distant sweet dream
Come here, babe
It will never dry up, oh
Dark underwater
What kind of me are you curious about?
Anywhere, freely
You can swim more
Without any boundaries
Like dancing, like that
So you can take your time
Oh, in eternity
A view that seems to have stopped, view (it is all you)
The emotions that I wake up
All of them true
I can't wait, babe
What's it gonna be?
What's it gonna be, babe?
You should show me (show me, yeah)
You're deeply locked in me
Filling my heart completely, babe, overflowing (oh, overflowing)
You can entrust yourself to be led by gravity
You make me want you more (you keep wanting me)
Quietly flowing in, seamlessly
Being able to breathe inside me, oh
Way up and down (up and down)
Go round and round (round and round)
You have no intention of leaving
Stay around again (stay around)
I want you, no one else
Just come lay your body on me
You can't wait, babe
What's it gonna be? (What's it gonna be?)
What’s it gonna be, babe?
You should show me (you should show me)
In a moment
Deep in me (in a moment, babe)
Filling my heart completely, babe, full
You can entrust everything to me when you reach the limit (oh)

Chill Kill - The 3rd Album,2023,Iced Coffee,"Every morning, eventually in front of you
I stand as if possessed again
The sleepiness not fully gone
Leads me to you
In my empty heart
Filled with ice
You pour, full of taste, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take a mouthful
Cold enough to be chilling
Even if it's bitter
Yeah, I don't care
The more I indulge in you
My every night grows longer
Until the tip of my head
Dizzyingly paralyzed inside me
All my senses
Stopped at that fleeting temperature
Oh, this cold and ecstatic feeling
'Cause you make me feel all this fantasy
I want more
Iced coffee
Fallin' in your eyes
Fallin' in your ice
Yeah, you got me like iced coffee
I don't need the sugar
Don't need the caffeine
I'm already in your thoughts
Behind the first bitter encounter
Lies the hidden sweet
Aren't you expecting that?
Even if my breath turns white
Even if it freezes
I only need you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Eventually, another sip
Even the addiction is sweet
Even if it's bitter
Yeah, I don't care
The more I indulge in you
My every night grows longer

Stopped at that fleeting temperature

Iced coffee
Fallin' in your eyes
Fallin' in your ice
Yeah, you got me like iced coffee
Got me up all night
Got me up all night
Yeah, you got me like iced coffee
Everyday transparently
Your eyes shining
As if possessed by you
Endlessly falling for you
Your unceasing warmth
Of a temperature that won't stop
Colder, more ecstatic feeling (ecstatic feeling)
'Cause you make me feel all this fantasy (make me feel)
I want you more
Iced coffee
Fallin' in your eyes

Melting my heart
You don't know my secret

Before the candle burns out, by your side
Go back again, celebrate
Like the hands of a clock going backwards
I rewind time alone
The sweetness I fall into, still makes me excited
Ecstatic feeling
Unforgettable everything
If everything stops
I'll go back to your side
Smiling warmly, locking eyes
It’s your birthday
Popping champagne with you
This cake was all sweet

Before the candle burns out, by your side
Go back again, celebrate

As if urging, towards the end of time

I stop and turn back
Starting again, celebrate
Look into each other's wavering eyes
We'll celebrate through the night
Even the same scene feels new, you and I
We'll celebrate and cross the time
It’s your birthday
Everyday filled with you
Round and round, by your side
Let's be together again, celebrate

Bloom,2022,Marionette,"A starry night with no clouds
Moonlight illuminating the stage
It's not tomorrow, it's the time
Feel good good good
In the whimsical music
I am moved by the beat
A beautiful and painful show begins
The curtain rises
Hey, you
I hear a voice in my heart
Where are you?
Always the same dance
It's boring
The perfect scene I saw in my dreams
Decided, make it real right now
Untangle the threads and cut them
The Marionette starts moving
The shooting star is an illusion
Just a blink of an eye
Look closely with your stolen eyes
The Marionette dances
Painful and scary
Confined in a narrow box
(I go) Don't just sit there
Rise high with just one step
(I go) Soon it became fun
With just one candle
It's my birthday
Redrew destiny
I'm not going back
The fleeting and mysterious show ends
The curtain falls
Hey, you
Don't hesitate, breathe in life
I am here
Even on a path where no one goes
I don't mind
The perfect scene I saw in my dreams
Decided, make it real right now
Untangle the threads and cut them
The Marionette starts moving
The shooting star is an illusion
Just a blink of an eye
Look closely with your stolen eyes
The Marionette dances
Entrust your body to the gentle wind
Dance freely
The moonlight and stars will be your companions
Oh
In my favorite night
Time goes slowly
Oh, baby
Unstoppable
Don't stop me now
The perfect scene I saw in my dreams
Decided, make it real right now
Untangle the threads and cut them
The Marionette starts moving
The shooting star is an illusion
Just a blink of an eye
Look closely with your stolen eyes
The Marionette dances"

Wonderful things happen before my eyes
I'm pleasantly surprised
Drawn across the sky
The light spreading, painting my heart
How is it that every time you look
It's filled with different colors
I can't help but love you
It's unbearable
When strange, unnamed emotions
Overwhelm me
Feeling like

Like a child lost in a strange land
A reality more unbelievable than fantasy
Perfect, much more than imagined
A ribbon cut neatly
Tied around my ankle
Stretching my arms, jumping up
The bar I hung from
In that moment, turning into tall stairs
Following you
You say beautiful things
You seem much more beautiful
Though short, it feels like our souls connect
The feeling of eyes whispering quietly
The spot where you fell with a thud

Spreading in the orange sunset
Pale excitement, green tonight

Wakes me up, just sway

Cold and thick milkshake
Spreading a tingling sensation
Make me crazy
Opaque you babe

Like a twist of vanilla scent
Your tone is nice, that's the clue
Softly you whirl me around
My heart digs in all night long

Oh my, in this moment, I’m not a kid anymore
So high, this strange feeling is thrilling
Ah nana ooh-la-la-la I like it
Just one bite shows it all
White foam on my lips keeps coming
Even if I pretend not to notice, it’s totally you
Ah ooh-la-la-la I like it

Ambiguous and vague, but still

Um, like this, so good (so good), so good to me (yeah, good)
So, so, so, so good now (good)
So good, so good
Comfort me when I'm excited
I'm captivated by that touch
Like ink, drop by drop, you spread day by day
I am gradually wearing the dark color of you
Sometimes, a bird that you don't know
This beginning is not important
Only now, it's tempting, woah-oh-oh-oh
Already drowning in, the calm waves crashing

I want to be like that sister
Why do you keep calling me cute? No
Like a little brother robot
Everything from one to ten is awkward (ha, ha, ha)
What should I do? I guess it's broken (I guess it's broken)
I even forgot how to breathe
Eyes, nose, mouth, facial expressions (oh no)
Arms and legs (walking)
You don't listen to me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Even the heart trembles
I feel like running wild
It doesn't work out the way I want it to.

The cold wind blows and your touch that tidies up the faraway
It feels strange and cold, you seem a bit shaky today
I think I know, two people in love
Should we start? The long-awaited time to love
Facing each other, holding back (I want to be angry) but I can't find the courage
After walking for a while, suddenly my palm is sweating
(It surprises my heart too)
Like a twinkling light, I shine in your eyes
I think I know, two people in love
Should we start? The long-awaited time to love
This doesn't make sense (makes me excited every time)
When you hold my hand (my face turns red, why)
Now my wish (like a dreamy distance)
Is about to come true (together with you)
If I close my eyes, will I come alive?
Not even a second is regretful, stay with me like this
The white snow falls (feels like a promise)
You come down in my heart (wrapped up full of you)
Oh, embraced in your arms, on this warm winter night

Through eye contact, through conversation
Fitting well (yeah, this is no joke)
Like the night before a birthday
Excited feeling, love cells awakened
So I'm weird
Tossing and turning for no reason, can't sleep
Why am I so restless?
Why am I like this again
Alone, acting like a fool fool
Why am I taking steps again
Alone, dancing like a fool fool
Feeling excited as if riding a roller coaster alone
Getting lost in my own world
It must be a dream, holding my cheeks tightly
Hurts, fool
Feeling like something will go wrong
(No, that can't be)
Can't focus, can't control myself
Thinking of you
But it's weird again
Smiling at your call again
Seems like I've fallen too deep
Why am I like this again
Alone, acting like a fool fool
Why are my cheeks pink again
Completely foolish, fool fool
Feeling excited as if riding a roller coaster alone
Getting lost in my own world
It must be a dream, holding my cheeks tightly
Hurts, fool
Liking you, hesitating again
Repeating like a fool
Even if you mess with my heart, I still smile
Why am I like this again
Alone, acting like a fool fool
Why am I taking steps again
Alone, dancing like a fool fool
Feeling excited as if riding a roller coaster alone
Getting lost in my own world
It must be a dream, holding my cheeks tightly
Hurts, fool
But you also seem weird somehow
Keep seeing me, keep smiling
Just like me"

Try to imagine what kind of melody it’ll be.
The simpler it is, the more beautiful it gets,
But the more you touch it, the more it loses its shine.
Sometimes, like a crescent moon, you’re so cold,
But when I hold you tight, you melt into something hot and sweet.
That sweet thing inside you,
Let me taste that simple, beautiful flavor.
That’s cool hot sweet love,
Our very own cool hot sweet sweet love.
Spread your white wings,
It feels dizzying, like standing on a cloud.
Such a pure emotion,
I’m just loving you.
Filling the song, I follow along, it’s so good,
We’re becoming complete,
Cold yet hot and sweet,
Our very own cool hot sweet love.
Cool cool hot hot sweet love,
Cool cool hot hot sweet sweet love.
Cool cool hot hot sweet love,
Cool cool hot hot sweet sweet love.
A little coffee on ice cream,
Caught my tongue in an instant.
As it melts, it takes control of me,
I realized what I really wanted.
Love doesn’t seem complicated,
Only when I express everything without lies.
That sweet thing inside you, let me taste that simple, beautiful flavor.
That’s cool hot sweet love,
Our very own cool hot sweet sweet love.
Spread your white wings,
It feels dizzying, like standing on a cloud.
Such a pure emotion,
I’m just loving you.
With your blue breath and pink warmth,
It’s so good, I can’t refuse,
Cold yet hot and sweet,
Our very own cool hot sweet love.
You can’t even imagine me throwing everything away,
That I’d choose you.
Don’t be surprised, it’s just begun.
Spread your white wings,
It feels dizzying, like standing on a cloud.
Such a pure emotion,
I’m just loving you.
With your blue breath and pink warmth,
It’s so good, I can’t refuse,
Cold yet hot and sweet,
Our very own cool hot sweet love.
We got a cool hot sweet love,
We got a cool hot sweet love,
We got a cool hot sweet love.

Staying up all night, it’s like a dream
Holding hands, we walk under the starry sky
No matter how much I look, it’s never enough
When I wake up in the morning, do you think of me?
When you see something nice, do I come to mind?
Do you ever find yourself smiling alone like I do?
Tell me, is this the first time? You’re falling for me too, right?
I want to know everything, is my heart deeper than yours? Like a fool
Every day we learn, little by little getting to know each other
The joys came slowly, oh is this love?
When we look into each other’s eyes, I become so honest
I feel like a kid again
You’re so beautiful, every day feels new
I’ve never felt anything like this before
Is your every day like this too?
Tell me, is this the first time? You’re falling for me too, right?
I want to know everything, is my heart deeper than yours? Like a fool
In the end, we’re one, somehow, in some way
I want it to be the first time and the last time
It can’t be perfect, like we’re only half
We fill each other up completely
Tell me, is this the first time? You’re falling for me too, right?
I want to know everything, is my heart deeper than yours? Like a fool
Today I realized how much I really love you for the first time"

Though I close my eyes
To open them and cry
It's just too deep a pain
That promise from long ago
Now just a memory, I say
With that cold smile
You drift away from me
The scent of roses drifts in the breeze
Sorrowful sighs scatter in the air
I can't hold on
To the way you’re fading away
I can't hold on anymore
That promise from long ago
Now just a memory, I say
With that cold smile
You drift away from me
The scent of roses drifts in the breeze
Sorrowful sighs scatter in the air
I can't hold on
To the way you’re fading away
I can't hold on anymore
My empty heart
Only wants you
The scent of roses drifts in the breeze
Sorrowful sighs scatter in the air

To the way you’re fading away

Before I knew you, what kind of person was I
What book deeply impressed me

It might be Pandora's box
Usually hard to hear talking (uh-huh, uh-huh)

Talking about the heart all night long (uh-huh, uh-huh)

The sound of crackling wood burning
Campfire reflected in my eyes
Remember this night
Oh, what more do we need
This is our own truth game
No lies, oh, oh, absolutely no, oh
Why hide unnecessarily
What is your favorite season
What is the treasure number one in your room
At least once, imagine
What was I like in your mind
Melting in your sweet voice
My heart is like marshmallows in cocoa (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Dancing softly in the warm
Bonfire, conveying feelings for you (uh-huh, uh-huh)

Whether farther or closer than I think
In my eyes, they all sparkle the same

Happy you around
Ooh, hey, uh-huh (hey, hey, hey)

His inner heart that no one has heard

Perfect morning to wander in a dream

When I close my eyes, time slips, anywhere's the best place
Slipping away, I love it

Why do your words keep cutting off?
Don't know why
Your eyes pretending to be serious awkwardly
Are cute, and I secretly smile
You probably don't like me like this

I'll think about it for a moment

Just rock the world, boo ya!
La la la la la la la
Happiness
La la la la la la la
Are you happy, uh?
Worries blow up
Change up the gloomy mood
Now gather strength, wind up
A single shot full of wonderful things
Straight up
Every day I style up, mood up
Focus on what's happening
Shall I tell you
The secret to living happily
In the morning, I wake up
Tell my mom I love her
(Ah, my sweet daughter)
Happiness that follows me closely
Is so cute, it makes me happy
(Uh, she said)
This money, that power
Just following, following, following
Seems like adults are busy
They are not really happy
Happy things, wonderful things
The world is truly, truly, truly vast
That money, that power
We've long stopped caring
Different, different, I want to try
Just do it
Thinking and worrying, when you become an adult
You'll have a lot of regrets
Yesterday, today, tomorrow, seeking happiness
My adventure diary
Different, different, I believe in the power of positivity
I trust
La la la la la la la
Happiness
La la la la la la la
I want
La la la la la la la
Let's dream
La la la la la la la
Uh, are you happy, uh?
On the way to school, met a friend
Ran up to me, linked arms
Smiled at me, it's nice
Gathered together, teasing each other
The boys, as I pass by
Conscious of me, it's nice
She nags, but in the world
I'm the best, says mom
Hey, hey, except for the fights
On TV, adults know nothing
I'm happy because I'm me, getting better and better
What makes me feel even better is having you by my side
Uh, what you wanna be?
This money, that power
Just following, following, following
Seems like adults are busy
They are not really happy
Happy things, wonderful things
The world is truly, truly, truly vast
That money, that power
We've long stopped caring
Different, different, I want to try
Just do it
Thinking and worrying, when you become an adult
You'll have a lot of regrets
Yesterday, today, tomorrow, seeking happiness (getting better and better)
My adventure diary
Different, different, I believe in the power of positivity (I'm happy because I'm me)
I trust
La la la la la la la
Happiness
La la la la la la la
I want
La la la la la la la
Let's dream
La la la la la la la
Happiness
Shine on me, let it shine on me
In my arms, let it shine
Shine on me, let it shine on me
In my two arms, let it shine
La la la la la la la
Happiness
La la la la la la la
I want
La la la la la la la
Let's dream
La la la la la la la
Happiness"
