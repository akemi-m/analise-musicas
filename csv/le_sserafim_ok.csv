HOT (LE SSERAFIM Package),2025,HOT,"I'm burning hot
A dangerous drive, switchin' up the gear
Blazing sunset glow, you and my tears so
Don't be afraid, no doubts at all
Take my hand
'Cause tonight we burn to shine, yeah
Now hold me tight, my dear, in the scars we share
Inside our hearts
The engine's stained in red, if you remember me
The way I'm in your eyes forever
I'm burning hot (hot)
If I can live life my own way
Turning to ashes ain't no problem
So tonight, in your embrace
Bonnie and Clyde it, oh
Not running from it, not running from it
Flames rising high, I love it
Let me live
I'm burning hot
Just like a phoenix soaring across eternal skies
You're just like a miracle making me dream again tonight
Once again, my embers glow hot, sprouting wings
Now hold me tight
Throwing my body into flames, no hesitation, no regrets
It's all right, we're ride or die, yeah
The engine's stained in red, if you remember me
The way I'm in your eyes forever

Act like you don’t know, what’s up with you?
Our hearts are racing, can’t you feel it?
That L-O-V-E, I’ve only heard about it
Love feels fictional, didn’t see this coming
Tapping on it twice with one hand
Why are you trying to hide your face?
Alright, those three little words
Sound so uncool when you say them
Hurry up before we miss it all
Sometimes being bold is better
Don’t doubt it, you and I
Right this moment
I want your lo-lo-lo-loving
Let’s stop pretending
Wa-wa-wa-want it
We both want it, that
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum

You lo-lo-lo-loving, let’s stop being scared, like
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum
Replay old days
Back then I was so afraid
My heart was closed, scared of getting hurt, so blue
You too, it’s time to make a choice
Don’t avoid the decision
Stop playing it cool
What you waiting for?
I like being cool with friends
But not with you, you know?
Alright, those three little words
Sound so uncool when you say them
Hurry up before we miss it all
Sometimes being bold is better
Don’t doubt it, you and I

Half of life must be suffering
The remaining half is up to us
I realized this fact a little early
The pain of facing that truth
Behind the dark stage

Endless proof
Doubt

Despite it all, my ambition and aspirations are unstoppable
An immeasurable future
I'm struggling the most, aren't you?
Still, I won't sink
I'll keep struggling without rest
I'll create small waves
When things aren’t easy, I will make them easy
I believe in you who held my hand
I'll believe that there's beauty in cruelty
Because you and I, we have good bones
Look at the truth
Instead of the misconception that I made it look easy
Because I’ve made it look easy

Delusions stop
I've never really liked you
I'm not even a little disappointed
Deceiving myself all day, all night, yeah
Grapes that are still unripe
It seems like it's not my time yet
Your scent, still slightly ripe
I'm feeling scared, I'm feeling scared, yeah
Sour tears, a sour taste
Sour, if that's what love is
I don't want to taste it, I just feel afraid
Love is sour, love is sour grapes"
